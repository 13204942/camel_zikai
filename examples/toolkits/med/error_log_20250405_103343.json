    "question": "A 54-year-old male presented to the emergency department for shortness of breath. His past medical history was remarkable for severe emphysema/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asbestos exposure, and erosive RA with positive rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-CCP antibody. He was diagnosed with RA more than 20 years ago but has only been on steroids in the past, more so for his lung problems. He had never been on DMARDs (Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs) treatment and never followed with a rheumatologist. His medications included Spiriva inhaler, Ventolin inhaler, and prednisone 15 mg daily. Social history was remarkable for smoking 40 years of 1.5 PPD and quit 5 months before the presentation. Family history was remarkable for RA in his mother and aunt. He admitted shortness of breath, fever, night sweat, and unintentional weight loss about 30 lbs over the past few months. Physical examination was significant for bilateral lungs wheezing on auscultation, bilateral swan neck deformity of digits, and Z deformity of bilateral thumbs. Joints range of motion was intact with no RA nodule or active synovitis. Laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cells 710/µL with 76% lymphocytes, 6.0% neutrophils, 16% monocytes, 1.0% eosinophils, and 1.0% basophils; hemoglobin 10.6 g/dL; platelet 160 000/µL; total bilirubin 0.9 mg/dL; alkaline phosphatase 68 U/L; alanine aminotransferase 18 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase 16 U/L; and serum albumin of 2.4 g/dL. C-reactive protein 3.4 mg/dL, antinuclear antibodies (ANA) was positive, RF was 3810.0 IU/mL, and anti-CCP antibody was 250 U/mL. Serum SSB/SSA, dsDNA, C3, and C4 were within the normal limit. Chest X ray showed pulmonary emphysema, bibasilar subsegmental scarring, and pleural effusion. Bilateral hand X-ray showed carpal periarticular osteopenia, carpal bone erosions, and swan-neck deformity of the bilateral fifth digits. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen revealed mild splenomegaly (14 cm). Hematology/oncology was consulted. Peripheral blood smear revealed numerous large granular lymphocytes. Bone marrow biopsy and aspiration were reported as insufficient for diagnosis. Immunophenotyping of bone marrow revealed an increased number of T-cell lymphocytes about 91% of cells analyzed with marked aberrant loss of CD5 and moderate loss of CD7. CD4:CD8 ratio was markedly decreased (0.23) with an abnormal increase in CD8 cells. NK cells were within normal limits. Approximately 40% of the T-cell lymphocytes express a marker profile consistent with T-LGL cell lineage (positive for CD3, CD57, and CD8; negative for CD25). Clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor gamma (TCRG) and beta (TCRB) genes detected by polymerase chain reaction consistent with the presence of a clonal T-cell population. These results were consistent with T-LGL. The patient was diagnosed with T-LGL and started on Cytoxan 100 mg PO (per os) daily. Methotrexate was avoided due to severe lung disease. In 1-year follow-up, leukocyte count was 7860/µL with neutrophils of 74%. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 59-yr-old man presented to the emergency department complaining of continuous epigastric and right upper quadrant pain for the previous 3 weeks on 23th March, 2009. He had no history of hypertension or diabetes. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes every day for 40 yr and was a social drinker. He did not have any changes in bowel habit or hematochezia. The patient had undergone a gastrofiberoscopy and colonoscopy 20 days earlier in a local clinic. Endoscopic findings had revealed chronic gastritis and a polyp in the colon. Fatty liver had also been reported on the abdominal ultrasonography.\nThe patient had the persistent abdominal pain worsened during the last 3 days. He had focal rigidity and tenderness in the right upper quadrant of his abdomen. His initial vital signs were: blood pressure 110/60 mmHg, pulse rate 88/min, respiratory rate 20/min, and temperature 36.3℃. Six hours after presentation, he complained of chills with a high body temperature of 38.0℃. The complete blood count showed a white blood cell count of 16,800/µL, hemoglobin concentration of 14.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 350,000/µL. Blood chemistry data revealed severe increases in C-reactive protein (346 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (55 mm/hr), with mildly elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase (127 and 175 IU/L). Bilirubin, albumin, and other blood component chemistries were all within the normal range.\nPlain radiographs of the chest and abdomen were unremarkable. Pre-contrast and contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed an approximately 6.0 cm, ill-defined heterogeneous enhancing hypodense mass lesion in the gastrocolic ligament (). The mass extended to its peripheries, with ill-defined infiltration of the surrounding omentum. Radiologists called for further workup to differentiate among metastatic mass, primary omental tumor, and omental infarction.\nViral and tumor markers, including carcinoembryonic antigens, alpha-fetoproteins, CA 19-9, and CA 125, were within normal ranges. Gastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy showed simple chronic gastritis. Abdominal ultrasonography displayed an ill-defined, heterogeneous echogenic mass between the stomach and transverse colon (). Further imaging with positron emission tomography CT revealed a large intense hypermetabolic mass in the gastrocolic ligaments without evidence of metastasis. An exploratory laparotomy was consequently performed under the impression of necrotic tumorous lesion.\nThe operative field revealed a 4-cm crab leg embedded within the approximately 6-cm abscess in the perforated antrum of the stomach (). Streptococcus sp. was cultured from the abscess. The patient underwent antrectomy, vagotomy, and transverse colon wedge resection. A detailed history taken after surgery uncovered the Kanjang-gaejang ingestion three weeks before, one day prior to the onset of abdominal pain. Twenty days after admission, the patient was discharged from the hospital with no complications. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 90-year-old male who presented with symptoms of general weakness and poor oral intake visited the emergency department of our hospital. He was diagnosed with hepatitis C-related liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in our hospital. Abdominal computed tomography had been performed about one month previously and had revealed multiple viable HCCs in both lobes of the liver. Their largest diameter was 10.7 cm (). The patient's HCC was classified as stage B according to the Barcelona Clinic Cancer staging classification. He had undergone radio frequency thermal ablation (RFTA) once and TACE six times in our hospital. Two days ago he visited our outpatient clinic with symptoms such as general weakness, nausea, and vomiting. Because the symptoms had suggested adrenal insufficiency, he had been empirically administered prednisolone 10mg per day by the oral route for two days. ACTH stimulation test couldn't be performed at our outpatient clinic and the patient refused the test. Else he had been taking furosemide 20 mg, aldactone 50 mg a day. Before taking prednisolone, serum creatinine was 1.12 mg/dL, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 65 mL/min/1.73 m2, and his renal function had been well preserved considering his age.\nThe patient's vital signs were within normal limits at our emergency department. On physical examination, the abdomen was distended, without tenderness or rebound tenderness. A complete blood cell count showed mild leukocytosis with mild anemia: leukocytes, 14.4 × 103/µL; hemoglobin, 10.8 g/dL; and platelets, 180 × 103/µL. The following additional laboratory values were found: serum sodium, 145 mEq/L; potassium, 5.4 mEq/L; chloride 110 mEg/L; bicarbonate 24.0 mEq/L; total protein, 7.1 g/dL; albumin, 3.0 g/dL calcium, 8.7 mg/dL; inorganic phosphorus, 5.8 mg/dL. In addition, serum urea nitrogen level was 100.5 mg/dL, creatinine level was 3.00 mg/dL, eGFR was 21 mL/min/1.73 m2. AST was 310 U/L, ALT was 171 U/L, total bilirubin was 5.24 mg/dl, prothrombin time was 12.5 sec, α-fetoprotein (AFP) was 647.4 ng/mL. His Child-Turcotte-Pugh score was 9. Chest radiography revealed only an old tuberculosis lesion in the right upper lung zone. His electrocardiogram was normal. Because he had acute kidney damage, and adequate hydration could not correct it, hepatorenal syndrome was suspected. He was treated by intravenous hydration at first, and was also administered terlipressin and albumin.\nThough serum uric acid was 8.0 mg/dL about 6 months ago, the following day, serum uric acid increased to 18.3 mg/dL. Serum sodium was 146 mEq/L, potassium was 5.4 mEq/L, inorganic phosphorus was 6.2 mg/dL, calcium was 8.7 mg/dL, serum urea nitrogen level was 104.6 mg/dL, creatinine level was 2.90 mg/dL, and eGFR was 22 mL/min/1.73 m2. Though oliguria was not present, his urine output was lower than a day earlier. Hydration and treatment for hepatorenal syndrome were maintained.\nIn next day, he had severe metabolic acidosis and acute kidney injury. Multiple organ failure progressed steadily, and he expired three days after admission. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 16-year-old female patient presented with a history of fever, joint pains, amenorrhea and generalized body swelling since 6 months. Fever was of high grade, intermittent in nature, associated with erythematous rashes which were localized to the upper trunk and back. Joint pains mainly involved the elbow and knee joints, and were associated with redness and swelling restricting movement. There was a history of recurrent oral ulcers, decreased appetite and significant weight loss. There was no history of urinary disturbances, bleeding tendencies, abdominal distension, altered bowel habits, altered mentation, photosensitivity or bluish discoloration of skin/mucous membranes. There was no past history of delayed developmental milestones, blood transfusions, diabetes, or thy. There was no family thyroid disease or any other chronic illness. No family member suffered from a similar disease.\nOn general examination, the patient was febrile with an oral temperature of 39.6°C. Vitals were within normal limits. Pallor, pedal edema and facial puffiness were evident. There were enlarged, non-tender, mobile lymph nodes present in the cervical region. Erythematous, non-tender, non-blanchable rashes were present over the chest and upper back (). Per abdomen examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly. Cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous system examination was essentially normal. On musculoskeletal examination, the patient had tenderness over bilateral hip joints, knee joints and small joints of hands (proximal interphalangeal joints and metacarpophalangeal joints) associated with swelling and redness.\nOn the day of patient admission the laboratory investigations revealed some abnormalities including anemia with hemoglobin of 7.9 g/dl, leukopenia with a leukocyte count of 3000/mm3, and platelet count of 150 × 103/µl. Renal function parameters were normal with blood urea of 18 mg/dl (10–50), serum creatinine 0.6 mg/dl (0.7–1.3), serum uric acid 5.1 mg/dl (4–7), serum calcium 7.9 mg/dl (8.5–10.5) and serum phosphate 3.4 mg/dl (2.5–4.5). Random blood sugar of the patient was 93 mg/dl. Liver function tests were slightly deranged, with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 60 U/l (up to 40), serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 79 U/l (up to 40), serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) 243 U/l (30–117), total serum bilirubin 0.8 mg/dl (0.2–0.8) and serum total protein 6 g/dl. The lipid profile was within the normal range. Anemia work-up showed MCV (mean corpuscular volume) of 125.4 fl/cell, MCH (mean corpuscular hemoglobin) 37.3 pg/cell, and MCHC (mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration) 30.1 g/dl, revealing a macrocytic picture. The corrected reticulocyte count was 0.16% and the serum ferritin level was 1144.6 µg/l.\nDirect and indirect Coombs’ tests were negative, and hemoglobin electrophoresis was normal. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was raised with a value of 140 mm/1st hour. The serum fibrinogen level was 280 mg/dl. Additional investigations included raised C-reactive protein (CRP; 100 mg/dl), negative antinuclear antibodies (ANA), negative rheumatoid factor (RF) and negative anti-dsDNA. Anti-SS-A/Ro antibodies, anti-SS-B/La antibodies and HLA-B27 were negative. To rule out infectious causes of fever a series of tests was performed: the malaria card test, Widal test, serology for Leptospira, Leishmania and scrub typhus, blood and urine cultures, Mantoux test, HIV antibodies, Hbs-antigen and anti-HCV antibodies. We also performed a heterophile test for Epstein-Barr virus infection and excluded presence of antibodies in IgM/IgG class to parvovirus B19 and autoantibodies for cytomegalovirus. None of the performed tests confirmed viral or bacterial infection.\nEye examination was normal. Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed hepatosplenomegaly and presence of free fluid. Echocardiography was normal. Lymph node biopsy showed diffuse follicular hyperplasia which suggested a chronic inflammatory state. Bone marrow aspiration revealed megaloblastic erythropoiesis. Minor salivary gland biopsy was undertaken to exclude Sjögren's syndrome, but there were no typical inflammatory infiltrates. Radiological investigations included X-ray of chest, hands and knees and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sacroiliac spine, which were normal (, ).\nIn view of the patient being a 16-year-old female with a history of fever, polyarthritis and rash, examination revealing hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy, and investigations showing high ESR and ferritin values, with absence of ANA and RF, a possible diagnosis of systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis was established.\nAs the patient had moderate to high grade fever, generalized edema, swollen and tender joints, and poor general condition, a possible association of JIA with MAS was suspected. The presence of ferritin > 684 ng/ml, platelet count of ≤ 181 × 109/l, AST level 79 U/l and serum fibrinogen level of 280 mg/dl satisfied the 2016 criteria for classification of MAS in sJIA, and hence the diagnosis was made.\nDuring the course of hospital stay, the patient received anti-inflammatory therapy, blood transfusions, glucocorticoids and methotrexate. The patient recovered dramatically within a span of two weeks. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 52-year-old woman with a known liver cyst and gall stone disease presented with 1 week of right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, nausea without vomiting, anorexia, jaundice and itching. She presented similarly 6 years before. At that time, computed tomography (CT) scan was suspicious for hydatid cyst, and local hospital echinococcal antibodies were positive. However, sent-out repeat tests were negative. The patient denied contact with animals but did have multiple visits to Jerusalem. Given low epidemiology in the United States, negative repeat tests and low suspicion, the patient was scheduled to undergo hepatic cyst resection for diagnosis, but she was lost to follow-up. On this admission, the patient was afebrile and had scleral icterus with mildly jaundiced skin. Laboratory results revealed eosinophilia (white blood cell count of 7,200/µL with absolute eosinophil count of 710/µL, Hb of 14 g/dL and platelet count of 299,000/µL) with biliary pattern liver function tests that showed alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 367 U/L with total bilirubin of 3.5 mg/dL and direct bilirubin of 3.0 mg/dL with elevated transaminases (aspartate transaminase (AST) 136 U/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 244 U/L). This time, echinococcal antibodies were positive for both local and sent-out ones. Ultrasound showed cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis and calcified right hepatic cystic lesion. CT scan demonstrated large hepatic hypodense lesion with thick calcified rim (). Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed hepatic cyst along with dilated central bile ducts and abrupt narrowing at the biliary confluence (). The endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) revealed mild stenosis in the upper third of the common bile duct (CBD) from external compression, and the copious mucus obtained through balloon sweeps showed scolices. Based on the presentation and workup, the patient was diagnosed with HLD concerning for cystobiliary fistula and was started on albendazole. The patient was scheduled for cholecystectomy and surgical cyst removal. Since the cyst was densely adherent to the right hepatic vein and inferior vena cava, radical resection was impractical. Therefore, she underwent partial cystectomy, cystobiliary fistula repair and omentoplasty. Subsequent intraoperative cholangiogram showed no leak (). However, 2 weeks after the surgery, the patient developed a refractory biliary leak for which aggressive endotherapy, necrosectomy procedures and cystobiliary fistula embolization failed (). The case was further complicated by hepatic abscess and colonic fistula that required multiple admissions and variable antibiotic courses, and for which the patient is planned to undergo percutaneous closure. Probable next step, per multidisciplinary team discussions, is right hepatectomy with or without Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, and right hemicolectomy with diverting loop ileostomy.

She denied any previous overseas travel history. The patient was seronegative for hepatitis B surface antigen, and for antibodies to hepatitis C, and HIV. She was diagnosed with autoimmune hemolytic anemia 2 years before the admission, and had been receiving corticosteroid monotherapy of 20 mg/day prednisolone. The patient was admitted because a chest X-ray showed new nodular opacities in both lungs, compared with a chest X-ray taken 6 months ago (). She did not report cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, or pleuritic chest pain. She denied fever, night sweats, anorexia, or weight loss. Body temperature was 36.8℃, respiratory rate was 18/min, and blood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg. The chest was clear to auscultation. The laboratory results were as follows: hemoglobin, 11.7 g/dL; white blood cell count, 6230/uL (88.4% neutrophils, 5.9% lymphocytes); platelet count, 152000/µL; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 12 mm/hr; C-reactive protein, 11.94 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 23 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.87 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 15 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 19 IU/L; total bilirubin, 0.61 mg/dL; and reticulocyte count, 4.39%. Blood and sputum cultures were negative for any pyogenic bacteria. Sputum was negative for acid-fast bacilli by smear. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed multiple ill-defined consolidations and cavitations in all lobes of both lungs with the absence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy (). The patient underwent a CT-guided lung biopsy. A histopathology study revealed many oval shaped, budding yeast-form fungal micro-organisms in the cytoplasm of CD68(+) alveolar macrophages (), which was clearly identified by Periodic acid-Schiff and Gomori Methenamine Silver stains. The patient was diagnosed with chronic cavitary pulmonary histoplasmosis. Therapy was initiated with 200 mg itraconazole orally three times per day for 3 days and maintained with 200 mg orally twice per day for 12 months.

This was his fifth visit to the hospital with similar complaints. He had a history of muscle invasive bladder cancer with peri-vesical tissue involvement, for which he underwent radical cystoprostatectomy with ileal conduit urinary diversion 7 years prior to presentation, after which he was lost to follow up. He did not take chemotherapy or radiation. He also had a history of Stage III chronic kidney disease, alcohol use of approximately 2–3 cans of beer daily for the last 40 years, and a history of medication non-compliance and non-compliance with follow-up appointments. He denied any history of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, back pain, blood in stools, hematemesis, or any other site of bleeding. He gave a history of fatigue, dizziness, and on and off painless bleeding from his ileal conduit site for over a year. At presentation, his heart rate was 103 beats/min, blood pressure was 126/60 mmHg, and respiratory rate was 18/min, saturating at 91% on room air. His examination was unremarkable except for gross bleed in his urostomy bag with blood clots. [His investigations revealed a hemoglobin of 3.8 g/dL (13.5–17.5), white blood cell count of 6.1 K/μL (4–11 K/μL), platelet count 114 K/μL (140–400), International Normalised ratio (INR) 1.38 (0.85–1.12), prothrombin time 17.6 s (12.1–15.0), total bilirubin 0.7 mg/dL (0–1.3), aspartate aminotransferase 40 U/L (14–59), alanine aminotransferase 36 U/L (11–66), and alkaline phosphatase 69 (38–126 U/L).] The patient's creatinine was elevated at presentation at 2.78 mg/dL (0.50–1.30), from his baseline creatinine of 1.32 mg/dL (estimated glomerular filtration rate = 56 ml/min/1.73 m2). After volume resuscitation, his creatinine improved to 1.4 mg/dL. He was transfused with packed red blood cells (PRBC's). His noncontrast computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis showed subtle nodularity of liver contour and mild splenomegaly (14.1 cm in length). Flexible cystourethroscopy through ileal conduit showed a small area of hemorrhage in the anterior portion of the conduit just deep to the abdominal wall fascia. The hemorrhagic site was fulgurated without evidence of other bleeding sites. On further examination, purple discoloration of the ileal stomal site was noticed []. Given his recurrent episodes of bleeding from the stomal site, purplish discoloration of the skin around the stoma, and liver nodularity, there was a high degree of suspicion of underlying liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension and extrahepatic peristomal varices. He underwent CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast, which showed heterogeneous density and enhancement of the liver, nodularity of the liver edge, and parastomal varices with mild ascites []. He was treated conservatively with octreotide for variceal bleeding. During the evaluation of his liver cirrhosis, his hepatitis C antibody was reactive, and his hepatitis C RNA load was 121012 IU/mL. Evaluation for hepatitis B was negative; abdominal Doppler did not show any portal venous thrombosis. His model for end-stage liver disease score at the time of TIPS procedure was 16 points, 6% estimated 3-month mortality. He successfully underwent TIPS with portosystemic pressure gradient reduction from 10 to 4 mmHg in addition to the coil embolization of ileal conduit varices by an interventional radiologist. The patient was advised to follow up with hepatology and gastroenterology for further evaluation for cirrhosis and treatment of his hepatitis C infection, respectively, and with endoscopy for evaluation of esophageal varices. He was seen in the hepatology clinic at 5 months; at which time he did not have any new episode of bleeding He was lost to follow-up after that appointment.

    "question": "A 43-year-old female with a past medical history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia presented to the hospital with progressive shortness of breath, polyuria, dysuria, and polydipsia. The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) five days before coming to the hospital. Physical examination revealed hypoxia with decreased lung sounds and negative abdominal findings. Her labs on initial presentation revealed white blood count 21.2x109/L (normal range = 4.5 to 11.0 x 10^9/L), hemoglobin 15.1 gm/dl (normal range = 12 to 15.5 gm/dl), prothrombin time 12 seconds (normal range = 11 to 12.5 seconds), international normalized ratio (INR) 1.2 (normal range = < 1.1), fibrinogen 620 mg/dl (normal range = 200 to 400 mg/dL), D-dimer 2.03 mcg/mL fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU) (normal range < 0.5 mcg/mL FEU), blood glucose 430 mg/dl (normal range < 140 mg/dL) with an elevated anion gap, lactate 3.4 mmol/L (normal range = 0.5 to 1 mmol/L), and normal total bilirubin/liver enzymes.\nCT chest revealed extensive consolidative airspace opacities with ground glass opacities while the CT abdomen was normal (Figure ). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for diabetic ketoacidosis and progressive respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation on day 2 of hospitalization. Her pulmonary condition was further complicated by pulmonary edema likely related to cytokine release syndrome. She was initially treated with hydroxychloroquine and as her inflammatory markers continued to rise, she was administered tocilizumab on the day of intubation. Two days after the tocilizumab, the patient also received COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Her ICU course was further prolonged by superimposed bacterial infections including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, treated with vancomycin, aztreonam, and meropenem, as well as fungal urinary tract infection, treated with fluconazole. She was successfully extubated eleven days later and was transitioned to the step-down unit.\nOn day 15 of admission, the patient developed severe right upper quadrant pain and back pain.Her complete blood count revealed hemoglobin of 6.1 gm/dl (normal range = 12 to 15.5 gm/dl), platelet count of 217,000/microliter of blood (normal range = 150,000 to 400,00/microliter of blood). The coagulation panel showed a prothrombin time of 13 seconds (normal range = 11 to 12.5 seconds) and an INR of 1.3 (normal < 1.1). Comprehensive metabolic panel revealed a sudden increase in liver enzymes with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 1111U/L (normal range = 5 to 40 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 1020 U/L (normal range = 19 to 25 U/L), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 203 IU/L (normal range = 44 to 147 IU/L) with normal total bilirubin (normal range = 0.1 to 1. 2 mg/dL). CT abdomen without contrast revealed a heterogeneous attenuation pattern area in the right hepatic lobe (Figure ). A follow-up ultrasound abdomen with Doppler confirmed patent vasculature. We obtained a three-phase liver CT with contrast which showed large areas of heterogeneous hypodensity and heterogenous enhancement most consistent with intraparenchymal hemorrhage (Figure ). At this point, the patient's hemoglobin had also dropped by 2 gm/dl but fecal occult blood was negative, ruling out any gastrointestinal lumen bleeding. The patient was transfused with two units of packed red blood cells and her prophylactic anticoagulation was held.\nWhile admitted, the patient’s AST peaked at 2177 U/L, ALT peaked at 1881 U/L and ALP peaked at 369 U/L. After discussing with the gastroenterology team, we started her on a trial of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for her acute liver injury. Labs after a 21-hour infusion of NAC revealed a drastic and rapid improvement of her transaminitis. CT abdomen was repeated the next day which showed stabilization in the heterogeneous area in the right hepatic lobe. The patient continued to improve from the cardiorespiratory and gastrointestinal point of view and was discharged to an acute care rehab facility with normalized liver enzymes.

    "question": "A 35-year-old female with ESRD was admitted to our hospital 2 years ago. She had a history of aplastic anaemia since she was 11 years old and was complicated by chronic hepatitis C probably due to frequent blood transfusion. She underwent peripheral blood stem cell transplantation at the age of 32. Her renal function deteriorated rapidly after the treatment. She started PD with the regimen of a single 6-h dwell of 2 L glucose dialysate. Considering that her genotype of HCV was 2a, which is known to be more susceptible to IFN therapy than genotype 1, and that she was a candidate for cadaveric kidney transplant, we decided to treat her with PEG-IFN alpha-2a (Pegasys&#61650, Hoffmann-LaRoche, Basel, Switzerland) monotherapy 1 year after the beginning of PD.\nLaboratory results before introduction of PEG-IFN were as follows: white blood cell count, 7000/μL; neutrophil count, 56%; haemoglobin, 9.9 g/dL; platelet count, 261 000/μL; serum albumin, 3.9 g/dL; aspartate transferase, 13 IU/L; alanine transferase, 16 IU/L and HCV-RNA, 3600 KIU/ml. Because IFN may adversely affect residual renal function, we adopted a dose escalation strategy in order to minimize the total dose of PEG-IFN. Thus, the treatment was initiated at a dose of 30 μg subcutaneously once a week for the first 6 weeks, being escalated to a maximum dose of 90 μg over the next 4 weeks and continued for subsequent 38 weeks. The plasma HCV-RNA levels decreased to be undetectable at the 17th week and constantly negative thereafter. During the PEG-IFN therapy, flu-like symptoms and progression of anaemia were observed, which were treated by a transient cessation of PEG-IFN therapy for a couple of weeks and an increase in the dose of erythropoietin, respectively. The residual renal function remained stable during the course of 48 weeks (renal Kt/V; from 1.28 to 1.26). Six months after the end of the treatment, sustained virological response (SVR) was achieved. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 17-year-old girl visited Chungbuk National University Hospital, presenting with fever and abdominal pain that had developed 7 days previously. She had undergone an operation for gastroschisis repair at birth. At the time of admission, her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 120/80 mm Hg; pulse rate, 70 beats per minute; respiration rate, 18 breaths per minute; and body temperature, 37.5℃. She appeared emaciated and acutely ill. Her body mass index was 18.1 (height, 151 cm; and weight, 41.3 kg). A physical examination revealed icteric sclera, a very thin abdominal cavity, and a longitudinal surgical scar at the midline. Tenderness was noted in the upper abdominal area, and normal bowel sounds were heard. There was no particular finding in the limb or neurological examinations. Laboratory analysis revealed a white blood cell count of 27,000 cells/mm3; hemoglobin level, 12.3 g/dL; platelet count, 277,000 cells/mm3; aspartate aminotransferase level, 108 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase level, 144 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase level, 476 IU/L; total protein level, 6.5 g/dL; albumin level, 3.7 g/dL; total bilirubin level, 14.1 mg/dL; direct bilirubin level, 9.2 mg/dL; amylase level, 592 U/L; lipase level, 825 U/L; blood urea nitrogen level, 5.0 mg/dL; and creatinine level, 0.5 mg/dL. These data were compatible with diagnoses of acute cholangitis and acute biliary pancreatitis. An abdominal computed tomography scan revealed a round calcifying lesion near the pancreas (), and the absence of the retroperitoneal duodenum and the anterior position of the spleen with respect to the left kidney. The anterior and left-sided position of the superior mesenteric vein compared with that of the superior mesenteric artery was observed in the abdominal computed tomography scan (). The coronal view revealed the distorted architecture of the liver and a high-attenuation lesion at the extrahepatic bile duct (). Results of a barium examination revealed a right-sided duodenojejunal flexure and malpositioning of the bowel, with the small bowel on the right side and the colon on the left side (). Intestinal malrotation could be diagnosed based on these findings. ERCP was performed by using a lateral-view endoscope in the usual way. After approaching the ampulla, the endoscope was pushed against the duodenal wall to maintain the papilla in the correct position, and a selective bile duct cannulation confirmed the presence of a 12-mm round stone in the common bile duct. With a guidewire-assisted technique, the single dark brown stone was removed by using a Dormia basket after the endoscopic sphincterotomy (). The procedure lasted for 15 minutes. A cholangiogram obtained through an endoscopic nasobiliary drainage tube revealed a distorted biliary system, which was characterized with diffuse dilatation of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary trees, downward-positioned gallbladder and a right intrahepatic biliary tree, and a horizontally located common bile duct. The abnormal orientation of the duodenum suggested intestinal malrotation (). Clinical symptoms and liver function tests normalized after the ERCP procedure. The patient has been monitored for 3 years and is in a normal state. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 42-year-old man was referred to our hospital for treatment after intentionally ingesting fertilizer containing 100% sodium silicate. He had ingested about 50 mL of fertilizer 2 days prior to admission. On presentation, he complained of a sore throat and epigastric pain. The patient had a medical history of unmedicated chronic hepatitis B and had worked in a car-manufacturing factory for 10 years. He had a 20 pack-year smoking history. On admission, his blood pressure was 130/78 mmHg, pulse rate was 98 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute, and body temperature was 38.3°C. He had mild painful oral erosion and his lungs sounded clear to auscultation. Laboratory results from another hospital immediately after the ingestion had revealed the following findings: serum creatinine (Cr), 1.1 mg/dL; white blood cell (WBC) count, 113,600 cells/μL; the arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) results were as follows: pH, 7.340; PCO2, 40.3 mmHg; PO2, 96.8 mmHg; HCO3, 21.2 mm/L; and O2 saturation, 96.8% on room air. On admission to our hospital, laboratory findings were as follows: hemoglobin, 16.3 g/dL; WBC count, 23,290 cells/μL; platelet count, 167,000 cells/μL; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 48 mg/dL; serum Cr, 5.06 mg/dL; total bilirubin, 1.7 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 68 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 43 U/L; and glucose, 140 mg/dL. ABGA results were as follows: pH, 7.415; PCO2, 36.6 mmHg; PO2, 73 mmHg; HCO3, 25.5 mm/L; and O2 saturation, 95% on room air. Urinary analysis revealed a pH of 6.0, specific gravity of 1.010, 2+ protein, 2+ glucose, trace occult blood, and no WBCs, with proteinuria at 550 mg/day. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) titers were below 1 : 40 (nuclear pattern) and results for other serologic markers were nonspecific. Abdominal sonography revealed increased kidney size with increased parenchymal echogenicity.\nDespite continuous fluid therapy, the patient's levels of BUN and Cr increased gradually, and thus renal biopsy was performed on day 3 of admission. The kidney biopsy showed acute tubular necrosis without infiltration of inflammatory cells. Although the histologic findings were not diffuse, definite features of tubular damage were noted. Necrotic sloughing of tubular cells was found, with mitotic figures present in regenerating tubular cells. Necrotic cellular casts were also noted in the tubular lumina (). Ultrastructural examination revealed electron-dense deposits in subendothelium of glomerular capillaries. And focal effacement and fusion of foot processes of podocytes were noted (). Tubular cells contained electron-dense lysosomes in the cytoplasm and lumina ().\nThe development of acute respiratory distress syndrome was observed on day 4: arterial PaO2/FiO2 < 100 mmHg. Corticosteroid therapy for acute lung injury was administered for 28 days, beginning on day 5 (1 mg/kg/day of intravenous methylprednisolone for 2 weeks, followed by a 2-week taper). Hemodialysis was provided 5 times from day 5 to day 10 for the treatment of hyperkalemia and oliguria. After the termination of hemodialysis, the patient's renal function recovered completely. During the administration of corticosteroid therapy, pulmonary fibrosis was observed on chest computed tomography. On day 16, bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous emphysema occurred. Although bilateral closed tube thoracotomy and a lung protective ventilation strategy were applied, the pneumothorax and pulmonary fibrosis progressed gradually. The patient died of complicated lung fibrosis and persistent pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum on day 40 of hospitalization. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 38-year-old Taiwanese man having a history of alcoholic liver cirrhosis, without regular medical follow-up, was admitted to the hospital. Right flank pain had occurred 10 days before this admission, and treatment was then prescribed for a muscle strain at a rural hospital. The pain, which radiated to the right upper abdomen, was accompanied with a fever, which developed for 3 days. The patient was then referred to our hospital for further analysis and management. Upon arrival to our hospital, his vital signs included a respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, a heart rate of 122 beats/min, blood pressure of 120/72 mm Hg, and a body temperature of 39.5°C. A physical examination revealed mild pale conjunctiva, rapid regular heart beats, tenderness, and rebounding pain over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, and also a knocking tenderness over the right flank region. Laboratory tests uncovered a white blood cell count (WBC) of 31,700/mm3, with segmented neutrophils at 96.6%, hemoglobin at 10.8 g/dL, platelet counts of 407 × 103/mm3, blood urea nitrogen at 50 mg/dL, creatinine at 2.7 mg/dL, lactate at 16.3 mg/dL, albumin at 2.3 g/dL, glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase at 122 U/L, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase at 49 U/L, lactate dehydrogenase at 486 U/L, alkaline phosphatase at 432 U/L, C-reactive protein at 40.4 mg/dL, blood glucose at 106 mg/dL, along with other test result levels which were unremarkable. A CT scan demonstrated fluid accumulation at the right subphrenic and retroperitoneal spaces, multiple cystic lesions within the right kidney, along with an irregular surface of the kidney adjacent to retroperitoneal fluid (Fig. ). Purulent fluid was aspirated from the right subphrenic space for analysis, with the results indicating there was a WBC of 78,750/mm3, with an 85% level of segmented neutrophils. Percutaneous catheters were implanted for drainage of the right subphrenic and retroperitoneal abscesses using ceftriaxone at 2000 mg once daily. Six days later, an uncontrolled sepsis persisted due to the patient's failure to respond to medical treatment. Subsequently, a nephrectomy for the renal abscess was carried out involving debridement of the retroperitoneal abscess. Anaerobic cultures of the right subphrenic and retroperitoneal abscess grew both A israelii and Bacteroides fragilis. Aerobic cultures of the ascites and abscess uncovered no traces of bacteria. An anaerobic culture of the nephrectomy specimen yielded A israelii. Anaerobic, aerobic bacterial, and fungal cultures of the patient's blood and urine proved to be negative. Acid fast stain and cultures for tuberculosis were not found in either the urine or nephrectomy specimen. The pathologic results revealed multiple renal abscesses involving actinomycosis with the characteristics of sulfur granules (Fig. ). A full course of antibiotics with intravenous penicillin G (3 million units every 4 hours) was prescribed for 2 weeks, followed by oral penicillin V given at a dose of 2 grams per day for 6 months at our out-patient facility.\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and all accompanying images.

He has been taking an angiotensin receptor blocker and digoxin due to hypertension and heart failure. He has suffered from repeated episodes of epistaxis from his teens and gastrointestinal bleeding from his mid-thirties. All of his five children also had the history of recurrent epistaxis. Also his sister was suffering from the sequelae of cerebrovascular accident. On physical examination, several telangiectatic macular lesions were found on his arms and trunk (). The laboratory work-up at first visit revealed the following: WBC, 4.6×103/mm3; platelet, 172×103/mm3; hemoglobin, 12.6 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 42 IU/L; alanine aminotranferase (ALT), 20 IU/L; hepatitis B virus surface antigen, positive; hepatitis B surface antibody, negative; anti-hepatitis C virus antibody, negative; and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), 345 ng/mL (normal, 0-20). Other laboratory results including bleeding time, coagulation time, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were normal. Gastroduodenal endoscopy disclosed a telangiectasia at the lesser curvature in mid-body of the stomach (). Liver dynamic CT (LDCT) revealed multiple HCCs in the right lobe of liver and there was no evidence of distant metastasis or vascular invasion. The HCC lesions showed heterogenous wash-out compared to well enhancing round homogenous AVMs in delayed phase of LDCT ().\nLiver transplantation was recommended, however, the patient refused it due to economic problem. TACE was performed in three consecutive sessions, but lipiodol uptake in the tumor mass was very poor at every session. HCC progressed after each TACE session. Fever developed up to 38℃, and AST and/or ALT increased more than two times of baseline following the first two TACE sessions.\nBecause of unusual TACE effect, we reviewed all the radiologic images of the patient and found an enlarged tortuous hepatic artery, multiple arteriovenous malformations, and early visualization of hepatic veins in LDCT () and hepatic angiography (). Based on these findings and positive family history, he was diagnosed as Osler-Weber-Rendu disease and genetic tests for the ENG and ACVRL1 were performed. Patient's genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood using the QuickGene DNA blood kit (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) and BigDye Terminatore V3.1 Cycle Sequencing Ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA, USA).

    "question": "A 64-year-old white male retired military intelligence officer had a 6-year history of cirrhosis associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection when he was admitted to a referral hospital for liver transplant evaluation. His HBV infection was thought most likely contracted in 13 years of military service in the Orient in the era of the cold war between capitalist and communist countries. The patient had no history of alcohol use, smoking or transfusions. The patient had a son, age 40, who had chronic hepatitis with negative serology for viral etiologies; the son had hyperpigmented skin and may have had elevated serum iron (according to family), but not diabetes mellitus. The patient had diabetes mellitus diagnosed 18 months ago and treated with oral hypoglycemic agents until 6 months ago when insulin therapy became necessary. He had an esophageal variceal hemorrhage 6 years ago treated with sclerotherapy and a splenocaval shunt. He had been experiencing increasing lethargy, confusion and easy bruising, starting 6 months ago. The patient developed jaundice, fatigue, poor oral intake, weakness, lethargy and mildly slurred speech, despite treatment with lactulose, spironolactone and omeprazole.\nOn admission, the patient was lethargic, with mildly slurred speech. His skin was markedly jaundiced. His temperature was 36.4o C, pulse 82/minute, blood pressure 110/60 mm Hg and respirations 16/minute. His chest was clear with no cardiac abnormalities noted. He had 2+ leg edema. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm and nonspecific T-wave changes. Chest radiograph showed moderate cardiomegaly and no pulmonary abnormalities. The patient’s bilirubin was 15 mg/dL (reference range [RR]: 0.3-1.5 mg/dL), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 119 U/L (RR: <40 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 222 U/L (RR: <40 U/L), gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GGT) 53 U/L (RR: <30 U/L), albumin 1.8 g/dL (RR: 3.5-5 g/dL), ammonia 74 umol/L (RR: 10-47 umol/L), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 16 mg/dL (RR: 9-20 mg/dL), creatinine 1.0 mg/dL (RR: 0.8-1.5 mg/dL), glucose 361 mg/dL (RR: 70-110 mg/dL), hemoglobin (Hgb) 11.1 g/dL (RR: 12.9-16.9 g/dL), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 102.4 fL (RR: 80-100 fL), white blood cell (WBC) count 15,500/mm3 (RR: 4,000-10,000/mm3) (80% segmented neutrophils, 3% bands, 9% lymphocytes, 7% monocytes, 1% atypical lymphocytes), platelet count 102,000/mm3 (RR: 140,000-440,000/mm3), prothrombin time (PT) 21 seconds (RR: 10.5-13 seconds) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 48.4 seconds (RR: 25-33 seconds).\nThe results of blood testing more specifically for liver transplant evaluation returned later, showing: hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive, anti-HBsAg antibodies negative, anti-hepatitis B core antibodies positive, HBV e antigen negative, anti-hepatitis A virus antibodies positive (IgM negative), anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies negative, anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV) antibodies >120 U/L (IgM negative), antinuclear antibodies positive at a titer of 1:40 (speckled pattern), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) 14.8 ng/mL (RR: <5 ng/mL), zinc 0.16 mcg/mL (RR: 0.55-1.5 mcg/mL), iron 106 mcg/dL (RR: 65-165 mcg/dL), iron binding capacity 107 mcg/dL (RR: 250-420 mcg/dL) and ferritin 4392 ng/mL (RR: 10-282 ng/mL).\nThe patient was treated with lactulose, neomycin, spironolactone, omeprazole and insulin. On hospital day 2, his WBC count was 19,800/mm3, glucose 338 mg/dL and ammonia 78 umol/L. Pulmonary function testing showed a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 2.34 L (88% of predicted), forced vital capacity (FVC) of 2.69 L (71% of predicted) and diffusing capacity of 19.9 mL/min/mm Hg (92% of predicted). Urine culture yielded Enterococcus faecalis, 50,000 colonies/mL. The patient remained afebrile, but that evening, he had increased lethargy and encephalopathy. His ammonia level rose acutely to 197 umol/L. His lactulose and neomycin were increased.\nOn day 3, the patient’s ammonia was 45 umol/L; he had brief episodes of atrial tachycardia. ECG showed sinus rhythm and nonspecific T-wave changes. Chest x-ray showed mild bilateral interstitial pulmonary edema and a left pleural effusion. Echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular size and function, but mild mitral regurgitation. Over the next 3 days, the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable but had increasing jaundice. On day 6, he complained of dyspnea on exertion as well as feeling tired, weak and sleepy. He was afebrile. His WBC count rose to 31,900/mm3 (90% segmented neutrophils, 5% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes).\nOn day 8, the patient was lethargic and slightly confused. His ammonia was 60 umol/L, bilirubin 25.5 mg/dL, albumin 2.2 g/dL, ALT 109 U/L, BUN 26 mg/dL and creatinine 2.5 mg/dL. He was given prednisone and zinc. Over the next 3 days, the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable but had increasing bilirubin, BUN and creatinine. He developed fine bibasilar pulmonary crackles with moderate pulmonary edema, along with left pleural effusion and cardiomegaly on chest x-ray, which was treated with furosemide. On day 12, the patient’s mental status had slowly deteriorated. His ammonia was 31 umol/L, bilirubin 37.5 mg/dL, ALT 71 U/L, GGT 55 U/L, BUN 60 mg/dL, creatinine 4.9 mg/dL and chest x-ray unchanged. Adenosine thallium cardiac scan showed fixed defects in anterior and lateral left ventricle. He was given bumetanide and metolazone. At 15:00, his blood pressure fell to 82/48 mm Hg, with heart rate 60/minute and respirations 16/minute. At 16:15, he developed sinus bradycardia (rate 50/minute). At 16:20, arterial blood showed pH 7.37, PCO2 29 mm Hg and PO2 32 mm Hg (on room air). With 100% oxygen via facemask, his PO2 improved to 63 mm Hg, with PCO2 35 mm Hg and pH 7.35. His blood pressure increased to 113/48 mm Hg at 20:00.\nOn day 13 at 00:05, chest radiograph showed decreased pulmonary edema. At 01:15, he was afebrile, but his blood pressure decreased to 89/43 mm Hg and an infusion of dopamine was initiated. At 03:00, emergency hemodialysis was started. At 03:20, the patient’s WBC count was 57,500/mm3, Hgb 10.1 g/dL, platelets 94,000/mm3, PT 20 seconds, sodium 132 mEq/L (RR: 136-145 mEq/L), potassium 3.6 mEq/L (RR: 3.5-5.1 mEq/L), chloride 97 mEq/L (RR: 95-110 mEq/L), bicarbonate 26 mEq/L (RR: 21-31 mEq/L), calcium 10.6 mg/dL (RR: 8.5-10.5 mg/dL), phosphorus 4.1 mg/dL (RR: 2.5-4.5 mg/dL), glucose 115 mg/dL, BUN 40 mg/dL, creatinine 3.7 mg/dL, ammonia 45 umol/L, ALT 121 U/L, AST 469 U/L, GGT 62 U/L and bilirubin 42 mg/dL. At 05:15, he developed labored breathing, with arterial pH 7.36, PCO2 36 mm Hg and PO2 38 mm Hg on 100% oxygen via facemask. Manual ventilation was started. He developed bradycardia with blood pressure 70/30 mm Hg. The patient then suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest and could not be resuscitated.

    "question": "A 30-year-old female with acute hepatitis was referred to our hospital in 1995. She had been asymptomatic until the disease onset. She had no history of significant medical condition, blood transfusion, or daily intake of medicine and did not consume alcohol. Her serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level had fluctuated from 300 to 1116 IU/L for 3 months before admission. On admission, laboratory examinations revealed total bilirubin 2.5 mg/dL, aspartate transaminase (AST) 842 IU/L, ALT 956 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 153 IU/L, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase 68 IU/L, γ-globulin 2.3 g/dL, and immunoglobulin G 2,710 mg/dL. Hepatitis B virus surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody were negative, antinuclear antibody was weakly positive (1:40, homogeneous), anti-smooth muscle antibody was positive (1:320), and anti-mitochondrial antibody was negative. Human leukocyte antigen was positive for DR-4. Histological analysis of the liver revealed marked interface hepatitis with rosette formation in the parenchyma. On the basis of these findings, she was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis and started on prednisolone (30 mg/day). Her serum ALT level gradually declined. Her prednisolone dose was tapered to 10–15 mg/day, which was administered with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA; 600 mg/day) to maintain her ALT level <40 IU/L. Since 2002, she had been treated by a doctor at home, and the aforementioned regimen was continued. In 2008, she developed steroid-induced cataract and was referred to our hospital to consult about treatment options for autoimmune hepatitis. At the time of referral, she was 150 cm in height and weighed 43.5 kg (body mass index 19.3 kg/m2), and she was being administered 12.5 mg/day of prednisolone and 600 mg/day of UDCA, and her serum AST and ALT levels were 23 and 34 IU/L, respectively. We added azathioprine (100 mg/day) to this regimen and gradually tapered the prednisolone dose to 10 mg/day; her ALT level was maintained between 22 and 40 IU/L with occasional mild flare-ups. In May 2012, she complained shortness of breath and easy fatigability and significant pallor was noted on physical examination. A hemogram revealed hemoglobin 6.4 g/dL, mean red cell volume 117.3 fL, reticulocyte count 0.6 %, white blood cell count 2,600 cells/μL, and platelet count 207,000 cells/μL. Laboratory serum analyses revealed total protein 6.0 g/dL, albumin 3.7 g/dL, AST 32 IU/L, ALT 42 IU/L, lactic acid dehydrogenase 221 IU/L, and normal bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels. Her serum iron level was 214 μg/dL, erythropoietin level was 3,750 mIU (normal 9.1–32.8 mIU), and vitamin B12 and folic acid levels were 307 pg/mL (normal 233–914 pg/mL) and 3.3 ng/mL (normal 3.6–12.9 ng/mL), respectively. She showed no symptoms of recent infection, such as fever or myalgia, and gastrointestinal endoscopy showed no evidence of hemorrhagic lesions. She was initially suspected of having azathioprine-induced anemia; therefore, azathioprine was discontinued. A red cell transfusion was performed, which increased her hemoglobin level to 8.3 g/dL; however, after 4 weeks, her hemoglobin levels decreased to 6.1 g/dL (Fig. ). Another transfusion was performed; however, severe anemia kept recurring and repeat transfusions were required. Her reticulocyte count was consistently low (0.2–0.6 %) except just after transfusion. In July 2012, bone marrow aspiration was performed, which revealed hypocellular bone marrow with an absence of erythroblasts. Giant proerythroblast was not observed and her serum was negative for immunoglobulin (Ig)M antibody to parvovirus B19, although viral DNA was not examined. Therefore, she was diagnosed with acquired PRCA on the basis of these findings, and CsA was administered on September 2012 at an initial dose of 6 mg/kg/day (250 mg/day). After 7 weeks, her hemoglobin level and reticulocyte count both showed considerable improvement (12.4 g/dL and 2.4 %, respectively). The CsA dose was gradually reduced and maintained at 1.6 mg/kg/day (70 mg/day) since April 2013, without relapse of anemia. Her cyclosporine trough blood level has ranged from 69 to 88 ng/mL. In October 2012, UDCA was discontinued and the prednisolone dose was tapered to 9 mg/day; prednisolone has been maintained at 8 mg/day since January 2013. The mild fluctuations in serum AST and ALT levels noted after azathioprine discontinuation ceased after initiating CsA therapy. Her AST and ALT levels have remained <20 IU/L for 8 months since the initiation of therapy. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

The patient had history of essential thrombocythemia (ET) and hemolytic anemia since 12 and 7 years ago consecutively. The ET was diagnosed based on bone marrow biopsy done that showed proliferation of megakaryocytes, not meeting other myelodysplastic syndrome. He was treated with hydroxyurea for 5 years and then substituted with azathioprine due to possible of hydroxyurea-induced hemolytic anemia. The patient was diagnosed of hemolytic anemia as the immunoglobulin G (IgG) on Coombs test was positive. Approximately 3 years ago, the patient experienced abdominal enlargement with tenderness on the upper left quadrant of the abdomen. Noncontrast abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan examination was done and the results showed hepatic cirrhosis, splenomegaly, portal hypertension and ascites. He had history of packed red cell transfusion due to anemia 7 years ago. A year before admission, he experienced mutiple episodes of hematemesis and melena that caused anemia and series of packed red cell transfusion. He underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which showed rupture of esophageal varives, which was then ligated ( and 2).\nAt admission, the patient was compos mentis with vital signs blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg, pulse rate of 96 beats perminute, respiratory rate of 17 times perminute, and temperature 36°C.

On admission, his blood pressure was 136/83 mmHg. A physical examination showed bilateral pretibial edema. No abnormal signs were observed in the lungs, heart, or abdomen.\nUrinalysis showed heavy proteinuria (5.1 g/g creatinine) without hematuria. His leukocyte count, hemoglobin level, and platelet count were 5,900/µL, 14.7 g/dL, and 191,000/µL, respectively. Serum total protein was 5.2 g/dL, albumin 2.4 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen 8.4 mg/dL, creatinine 0.79 mg/dL, alanine aminotransferase 16 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 11 U/L, lactate dehydrogenase 206 U/L, total cholesterol 261 mg/dL, IgG 572 mg/dL, IgA 345 mg/dL, IgM 93 mg/dL, C3 80 mg/dL (normal range: 65 – 135 mg/dL), and C4 12 mg/dL (normal range: 13 – 35 mg/dL). Tests for anti-nuclear antibodies, cryoglobulin, hepatitis B virus antigen, and anti-hepatitis C antibodies were all negative. Monoclonal proteins were not detected in the serum or urine. Circulating IgA-class anti-PLA2R antibodies were not determined by our in-house ELISA [] using peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgA as a secondary antibody.\nDue to the presence of NS, a renal biopsy was performed. Light microscopy showed global scleroses in 2 of 20 glomeruli. The functioning glomeruli showed no mesangial proliferation and no bubbling/spike appearance along the glomerular capillary walls (). In the tubulointerstitium, mild lymphocyte infiltration, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis were observed. There was moderate arteriolar hyalinosis. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed 2+ granular staining for IgA- and IgA1-heavy chains (b, c), 2+ granular staining for κ- and λ-light chains (f, g), and trace granular staining for C3 (h) along the glomerular capillary walls, but no significant staining for IgG-, IgA2-, IgM-heavy chains, or C1q (a, d, e, i). An immunofluorescence study using anti-PLA2R antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) showed negative glomerular staining. Electron microscopy revealed extensive foot process effacement of the podocytes, which contained large amounts of dense materials mainly in the area covering the surface of the glomerular basement membrane, but not in the mesangial area (a). Small amounts of electron-dense deposits were observed beneath the cytoplasm of the podocytes containing the dense materials (b). From the above-mentioned pathological findings, the diagnosis of early stage MN with solitary polyclonal IgA deposition was made.\nHe was treated with low-dose prednisolone (PSL) (10 mg/day for 8 weeks) in consideration of his history of type 2 diabetes. Thereafter, partial effects on proteinuria were observed, and PSL doses were gradually tapered. At the 3-year follow-up he was well. His urinary protein was 2.1 g/g creatinine, serum total protein 5.8 g/dL, albumin 3.5 g/dL, and creatinine 0.87 mg/dL. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "Ultrasonographic examination of an asymptomatic 62-year-old woman with chronic HCV genotype 1b infection revealed a hypoechogenic lesion in liver segment III. Active chronic liver disease was diagnosed 12 years previously based on liver biopsy that revealed a grade of 8 and stage 3 according to the Ishak staging system. Results of laboratory investigations were as follows: HCV RNA, 2530000 IU/ml; normal lactate dehydrogenase level (270 U/l [normal, 240–450 U/l]); haemoglobin, 12.9 g/dl; platelet count, 175.000/mm3; white blood cell count, 4900/mm2; aspartate aminotransferase, 40 U/l; alanine aminotransferase, 65 U/l; albumin, 4.1 g/dl and total bilirubin 1.0 mg/dl. Total body computed tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast revealed several nodular liver lesions with early arterial phase enhancement and slow washout with uncertain diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated hyperintensity on post-contrast T1-weighted images of the lesions and isointensity in the T2 phase (). Positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose demonstrated only intense fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in different areas of the liver as a unique localization of the neoplasm. A liver biopsy was prompted by the uncertain behavior of the liver lesions. Microscopic examination of the liver biopsy revealed infiltration of typical centrocyte-like lymphoid cells and lymphoepithelial lesions in these small- to medium-size lymphocytes (). Immunohistochemistry findings were positive for CD20, CD79a and BCL-2, and negative for CD3, CD5, CD10, CD43 and cyclin D1 (). A diagnosis of stage IV liver MZL was made. Bone marrow biopsy did not reveal infiltration of lymphocytes. After haematology consultation, it was decided to administer antiviral therapy with sofosbuvir (NS5B inhibitor) associated with simeprevir (a protease inhibitor) for a duration of 12 weeks. Three months after the conclusion of antiviral treatment, HCV RNA was negative, thus confirming the eradication of HCV infection. MRI performed 6 and 12 months after antiviral therapy demonstrated complete resolution of the liver lesions (). Currently, no liver lesions are apparent on MRI after 3 years of follow-up.

    "question": "A 73-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic alcohol use presented to the emergency department (ED) with fever, melena, and intermittent episodes of confusion. The patient was admitted to the hospital seven weeks prior to this admission for an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. His course was complicated by a right hepatic artery injury treated with ligation and clipping, with subsequent development of multiple hepatic abscesses, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, Enterococcus faecium bacteremia, and a bile leak. The bile leak required treatment with endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy and a common bile duct (CBD) stent placement. The patient was discharged to rehab with a Jackson Pratt (JP) drain (Cardinal Health, Dublin, Ohio) in place. He was continued on daptomycin and ertapenem for four weeks for hepatic abscesses per the infectious disease specialist. The patient returned to the hospital for recurrent fevers and melena. History was limited due to acute delirium but right upper quadrant abdominal pain was noted. He denied bright red blood per rectum, hematemesis, nausea, vomiting, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. His JP drain had a recorded output of approximately 30-40 cc/day.\nThe patient was febrile with a temperature of 101.7 Fahrenheit within a few hours of admission. Other vital signs were significant for sinus tachycardia, with 110 beats per minute, and tachypnea, with 22 breaths per minute. Blood pressure and oxygen saturation were at 154/65 and 100% on room air, respectively. The physical exam was notable for confusion, abdominal tenderness to palpation that was worse in the right upper quadrant, and the JP drain in the right upper quadrant. Laboratory findings on admission were significant for leukocytosis, with a white blood cell (WBC) count of up to 13,200/mm3. His hemoglobin and hematocrit were noted to be at 6.2 gm/dL and 19%, respectively, which was decreased from the hemoglobin of 10.3 gm/dL on the day of his last discharge. Platelets on admission were within normal limits at 213,000/mm3. His comprehensive metabolic panel from admission revealed transaminitis, with an elevated aspartate aminotransferase of 149 U/L, alanine aminotransferase of 134 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase at 51 0U/L. There was no significant elevation of total bilirubin. The patient's prothrombin time was elevated to 16.1 seconds, and the international normalized ratio INR was 1.41 on admission.\nOn day one, the patient became hemodynamically unstable, with worsening mentation, tachycardia, and tachypnea, requiring a transfer to the intensive care unit. Surgery and gastrointestinal medicine were consulted for evaluation. The patient underwent imaging with computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, which revealed persistent postsurgical changes of cholecystectomy and an unchanged common bile duct stent. A right-sided abdominal drain was noted to be in the right upper quadrant. Multilobulated, predominantly hypoattenuating masses were noted throughout the liver, with persistent hyperdensity, more centrally suggestive of combined multifocal hepatic abscess and central hemorrhage, also reported. He was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells (RBCs) and resuscitated with intravenous (IV) lactated ringer fluids. Blood cultures were obtained, and the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics.\nHe was taken for an esophagoduodenoscopy (EGD) to assess for causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). This did not show any evidence of active bleeding or hemobilia at the previous sphincterotomy site; however, the patient had significant melena noted at the end of the exam and was emergently taken for further evaluation with computed tomographic angiography (CTA). CTA revealed transient hyperdensity within the right lobe of the liver, adjacent to the right portal vein, suspicious for a hepatic artery injury/pseudoaneurysm as seen in Figure .\nFigure shows CTA findings of the clipped right hepatic artery from the patient's initial surgery.\nHe was then taken for visceral angiography by interventional radiography (IR), which confirmed a previous iatrogenic hepatic artery ligation and showed an arterial enhancing structure within the central aspect of the liver consistent with a hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm, as seen in Figure and Figure .\nThe patient’s pseudoaneurysm was not amenable to catheter-directed embolization, as there was no direct feeding arterial structure identified. He was subsequently taken to the operating room for a right hepatectomy. Post right hepatectomy, the patient remained tenuous and began to decline quickly after developing acute oliguric renal failure, which required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and resistant hypoglycemia. Additionally, worsening shock required pressure and, ultimately, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). Due to the patient’s acute decompensation and prolonged hospital course, his wife elected to move toward comfort care and withdrawal of aggressive measures.

    "question": "A 64-year-old male patient was admitted to the Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Dankook University Hospital (Cheonan, Korea) for treatment of progressive dyspnea and cough. The patient had undergone right lobectomy of the liver due to HCC at Severance Hospital (Seoul, Korea) on October 23, 2006. At that time, the surgical specimen was confirmed to be HCC, Edmondson grade II. After 14 months, a chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed multiple lung metastases and left adrenal gland metastasis. The level of serum protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II (PIVKA II) was elevated abnormally (207 mAU/ml). Diagnosed with recurrent HCC with multiple lung metastases and adrenal metastasis, the patient received palliative chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, adriamycin and carboplatin. Following two cycles of first-line chemotherapy, the disease progressed. The patient was administered two more cycles of second-line chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, etoposide and carboplatin, and three cycles of third-line chemotherapy with oral capecitabine. However, the disease demonstrated no objective response and further progressed. The patient and physician agreed to discontinue cytotoxic chemotherapy, and the patient was transferred to Dankook University Hospital for paliative care on February 19, 2009.\nThe patient was a chronic hepatitis B virus carrier and an older brother had hepatitis B viral liver cirrhosis. Initial laboratory data from our hospital was as follows: White blood cell count, 4,970 cells/μl; hemoglobin level, 17.2 g/dl; platelet count, 16.4×104 platelets/μl; aspartate aminotransferase : alanine aminotransferase level, 32:41 IU/l; total bilirubin level, 0.97 mg/dl; gamma guanosine triphosphate level, 17 IU/l; alkaline phosphatase level, 89 IU/l; protein : albumin level, 8.4:4.3 g/dl; prothrombin time (international normalized ratio), 13.2 sec (1.14); α-fetoprotein (AFP) level, 16.55 ng/ml (normal range, 0–15 ng/ml); and PIVKA II level, 12,900 mAU/ml (normal range, 0–40 mAU/ml). Hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase chain reaction test results were positive. At the time of admission, a chest radiograph of the patient revealed miliary nodules in the entirety of the lungs. CT scan of the chest and abdominopelvis indicated miliary metastases throughout the lungs, bilateral adrenal metastases and metastatic abdominal lymph nodes (). The patient was observed at regular three-monthly follow-ups. After the first three months, the patient continued to exhibit cough and dyspnea, and there was no definitive interval change of the multiple lung metastases on the chest radiograph. At the second visit on September 14, 2009, the general condition of the patient had improved, and the cough and dyspnea had stopped. A chest radiograph revealed that all metastatic nodules had disappeared (). Serum AFP level had decreased to 1.5 ng/ml. Spontaneous tumor regression of HCC was observed, and whole-body positron emission tomography-CT scan in December, 2009 revealed that all metastatic nodules in the lung, as well as the metastatic lesions of the two adrenal glands and lymph nodes, had disappeared. The patient had taken an alternative herbal medicine for approximately one week, on the recommendation of his family. The herbal medicine was Dendropanax morbifera Leveille, which is a subtropical, broad-leaved evergreen tree belonging to the family Araliaceae ().\nFollow-up CT scans revealed no recurrent lesions, and follow-up chest radiograph also indicated no metastatic lesions. Serum AFP and PIVKA II levels were within the normal range (). The patient is alive without any symptoms or signs as of May 2013. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 32-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse presented to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of bilateral feet numbness. The patient stated that he had consumed alcohol the evening prior to the presentation, and upon awakening the next morning, he had been unable to bear weight on lower extremities. He admitted to decreased sensation bilaterally, which extended from the foot to the ankle, more pronounced on the right side. Furthermore, the patient had a 7/10 dull pain sensation radiating from the lower back to bilateral lower extremities as well as generalized body aches. It was the progressive worsening of his symptoms that had prompted his hospital visit. He denied any other aggravating factors.\nIn the ED, the patient's vital signs were found to be remarkable for a temperature of 97.1 °F, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, heart rate of 124 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 146/27 mmHg. The patient denied any history of diabetes, kidney disease, or back pain. He had smoked half pack of cigarettes a day for \"a few years\", drank a pint of vodka three to four times a week, and used cocaine as well as marijuana daily for \"numerous\" years. He reported that he had used cocaine and marijuana a \"few\" days prior to the presentation. The patient's physical examination was significant for a decreased dull and sharp sensation of bilateral feet with intact sensation above the ankle as well as 1/5 muscle strength of bilateral legs and feet. The muscle strength was 4/5 in bilateral thighs as well as upper extremities.\nAn alcohol level screening was done in the ED, which revealed a level of less than 10 mg/dl. Urine drug screen was positive for cocaine, cannabinoids, and opiates. Lactic acid was elevated at 4.2. Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity greater than 1.030 with large bilirubin, proteinuria, and hematuria. Urine microscopy revealed red blood cells of 4-6 high power field (HPF).\nInitial complete blood count revealed a WBC of 20.9 K/UL with 83.2% absolute neutrophils, and hemoglobin and hematocrit level of 21.7 gm/dl and 64.1%, respectively, with a platelet count of 344 K. The patient’s complete metabolic panel was significant for elevated liver enzymes - aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 3,334 U/L (normal range: 15-41 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 850 U/L (normal range: 17-63 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (ALP): 151 U/L (normal range: 38-126 U/L); there was renal insufficiency with a creatinine level of 4.16 mg/dl (normal range: 0.7-1.2 mg/dl), urine nitrogen of 32 mg/dl (normal range: 8-20 mg/dl), and potassium of 7.4 mmol/l (normal range: 3.6-5.1 mmol/L) with high anion gap of 21. An arterial blood gas revealed PH of 7.23, PCO2 of 32 mmHg, HCO3 of 14.9 mmol/L, signifying metabolic acidosis with adequate respiratory compensation. CPK levels were markedly elevated at 100,809 U/L. Initial ECG revealed sinus tachycardia with peaked T wave as seen in Figure .\nThe patient received 2 grams of calcium gluconate infusion for cardiac membrane stabilization. He also received insulin and Kayexalate, which corrected his hyperkalemia. The patient was started on IV fluid (IVF) hydration with strict urine output monitoring. Initial MRI without contrast of spine was performed and was only remarkable for mild spondylosis without spondylolisthesis in the L4-L5 region. Neurology was consulted for a more thorough neurological examination, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and management.\nIn the ICU, the patient’s symptoms started to worsen and he reported progression of the numbness up to the knee in both lower limbs. He also complained of worsening pain and weakness in the right lower extremity. During the ICU stay, the right thigh became more swollen compared to the left. Urgent CT scan of the right lower extremity revealed right leg edema without focal tissue or osseous abnormality, as seen in Video .\nDoppler ultrasound showed normal arterial flow and no evidence of deep vein thrombosis. The patient started experiencing new-onset right lower extremity weakness. Dorsal pedis and tibial pedis pulses were present bilaterally. At this juncture, there were concerns for acute compartment syndrome. The patient was placed on neurovascular checks every hour. Intracompartmental pressures were measured frequently, which remained low. Also, surgery was consulted for possible fasciotomy.\nDespite aggressive IVF hydration, the patient’s CPK levels continued to rise. CPK levels peaked at 237,025U/L, even though his hemoconcentration had resolved. Creatinine levels continued to increase, and the patient became anuric and IVF hydration was discontinued. Vascular surgery and nephrology were consulted for emergent Uldall catheter placement and urgent hemodialysis, respectively.\nFollowing repeat sessions of hemodialysis, the patient's renal function improved and CPK levels declined. His lower extremity weakness also started to improve. There was a significant improvement in his left lower extremity numbness. The right leg swelling resolved; however, there was only a mild improvement of motor and sensory loss. The patient continued to undergo physical therapy during his hospitalization. He was subsequently discharged to subacute rehabilitation. The patient was advised to continue with outpatient hemodialysis till full recovery of his renal function was achieved. He was also recommended to follow up with neurology as an outpatient. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 27-year-old woman was referred to the emergency department with complaints of icterus, nocturnal fever, arthralgia, and abdominal pain. The patient had been well until two weeks earlier, when symptoms developed. She was a farmer in a village and owned a lot of sheep. There were no allergies and no history of recent use of drugs but she was consuming a large amount of nonpasteurized traditional cheese.\nOn physical examination, the patient was nonedematous. Her temperature was 38.5°C, with a blood pressure of 70/45 mm Hg, a pulse rate of 70 beats per minute, and respirations of 18 per minute. The oxygen saturation was 96 percent while she was breathing room air.\nThe liver edge was palpable 5 cm below the costovertebral margin. Her right upper quadrant of abdomen was diffusely tender to palpation. Additionally, there was marginal splenomegaly. The heart sounds and the results of the remainder of the examination were normal.\nLaboratory studies performed at admission revealed a WBC count of 5400 cells/mm³, a hemoglobin level of 10.6 g/dL, a platelet count of 216.000 platelets/mm³, an aspartate aminotransferase level of 224 U/L, an alanine aminostransferase of 159 U/L, an alkaline phosphatase level of 2340 U/L, a gamma glutamyl transferase level of 597 U/L, a direct bilirubin level of 3.1 mg/dL, an albumin level of 3.3 g/dL, a globulin level of 4.3 g/dL and a uric acid level of 1.4 g/dL. Serum pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal function tests were in normal ranges.\nHer other laboratory parameters included erythrocyte sedimentation rate 47 mm/hr, C-Reactive Protein level 26 U/L, serum sodium level 124 mmol/L, potassium 4.4 mmol/L, chloride 95 mmol/L, and plasma osmolality 262 mmol/kg/H2O. Urine biochemistry showed osmolality 274 mmol/kg/H2O and urinary sodium 64 mmol/L. Serologic tests for Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and hepatitis viruses were negative. Electrocardiographic examination showed minimal ST-T elevations.\nUltrasonography and Computed Tomography scan (CT scan) of the abdomen showed a small pericardial effusion with mild splenomegaly and hepatomegaly (Figures and ). However, there was no evidence of biliary dilatation or cholecystitis. CT scan of thorax and brain revealed no abnormality. Echocardiography detected mild pericardial effusion without cardiac dysfunction.\nAt the next day, serum agglutination test for Brucella was positive and its titer was 1/1240. The diagnosis of SIADH in association with cholestatic hepatitis and pericardial effusion due to Brucellosis was made. After intramuscular streptomycin (1000 mg/day for 20 days) with oral Doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for 6 weeks), the patient's symptoms, cholestasis, pericardial effusion, and hyponatremia resolved dramatically.

Heart sounds were regular and there was no murmur. The liver and spleen were not palpated. Palmar erythema, vascular spider, and peripheral edema were absent.\nInitial laboratory data revealed albumin 3.2 g/dL, total protein 6.4 g/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 229 IU/L, aspartate transaminase/alanine aminotransferase of 33/24 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase of 801 IU/L, total bilirubin of 0.6 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine of 12.5/0.89 mg/dL, white blood cell (WBC) count of 3430/mm3, hematocrit of 38.4%, platelet count of 150,000/mm3, prothrombin time (international normalized ratio) of 1.08, C-reactive protein of 0.07 mg/dL, and blood analysis of N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide of 257 ng/mL. Urinalysis revealed no proteinuria. Hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody were not detected.\nChest X-ray showed a significant right-sided pleural effusion. A thoracentesis was performed and 1500 mL of the pleural effusion was drained. The pleural fluid was yellowish, and an analysis revealed a pH of 7.3, glucose of 212 mg/dL, LDH of 105 IU/L, protein of 3.0 g/dL, red blood cell count of 330/mm3, WBC count of 1/mm3, adenosine deaminase of 11.9 IU/L, and carcinoembryonic antigen of 2.5 mg/mL. Pleural fluid was transudate. Culture for bacteria as well as an acid-fast bacillus smear and culture were negative. No malignant cells were observed.\nA chest computed tomography scan revealed no parenchymal lung disease or pleural thickening. On abdominal ultrasonography, the liver size and contour were within the normal range without evidence of ascites, but the liver parenchymal echogenicity was slightly increased, which was suggestive of fatty liver. We also performed an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which revealed gastric erosion but no esophageal varices. Echocardiography revealed no evidence of cardiac disease.\nWe repeated the thoracentesis every 3 days for 2 weeks and empirically prescribed diuretics. The collected fluids were also transudate, but the right-sided pleural effusion was not improved.\nAlthough laboratory findings and abdominal ultrasonography did not show the evidence of liver cirrhosis, due to her alcoholic history, we performed an examination using a transient elastography, which can measure liver stiffness. The transient elastography result was 35.3 Kpa, which was suggestive of liver cirrhosis. Accordingly, we suspected a hepatic hydrothorax in the absence of ascites. A radioisotope 99mTc-sulfur colloid injected in peritoneal cavity resulted in a positive uptake of radioactivity within the right pleural cavity (Fig. \n). This finding suggested that the pleural effusion originated in the peritoneal cavity and that there was a diaphragmatic defect.\nWe diagnosed the patient as having hepatic hydrothorax without ascites, which was the first sign of alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Once the patient was started on a strict low salt diet and a water restriction with diuretics, the pleural effusion slowly regressed. After 2 months of treatment, the hydrothorax was resolved.

    "question": "A 50-year-old female with past medical history of hypertension, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis) underwent a renal transplant from a living unrelated donor in June 2016.\nShe received the influenza vaccine in November 2017 at the outpatient transplant nephrology clinic. She presented to her next appointment eight days later with complaints of fevers with chills, night sweats, lethargy, headaches, myalgias, nausea, anorexia, left-sided pleuritic chest pain and multiple episodes of watery, non-bloody diarrhea. She was directed to the emergency department for further evaluation.\nShe denied sick contacts, recent travel, medication changes or medication non-compliance. At the time of admission, she was on prednisone 5 mg PO (oral) QD, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 360 mg PO QID, tacrolimus 0.5 mg PO BID.\nHer vitals on admission were significant for temperature 101.7 F, heart rate 100/minute, blood pressure 118/79 mm Hg, respirations 18/minute and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Physical exam revealed no acute abnormalities.\nAdmission labs were significant for white blood cell (WBC) 2,070/mm3 [normal range (N): 3,800-10,500/mm3], absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 1,865/mm3 [N: 1,800-7,400/mm3], lymphocyte count 500/mm3 [N: 1,000-3,300/mm3], platelets 108,000/mm3 [N: 150,000-400,00/mm3], aspartate transaminase (AST) 81 U/l [N: 10-40 U/l], alanine transaminase (ALT) 87 U/l [N: 10-45 U/l], alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 137 U/l [N: 40-120 U/l] and normal renal function. Electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm with no acute changes. Chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) ruled out the presence of pneumonia. Abdominal ultrasound showed polycystic liver and kidneys, contracted gallbladder with negative sonographic Murphy’s sign. CT of the abdomen and pelvis confirmed polycystic liver and kidneys, as well as mural thickening of ascending colon with mild surrounding inflammatory changes (suggestive of colitis) (Figures , ).\nUrinalysis was not suggestive of infection. Respiratory viral panel multiplex test was negative. Clostridium difficile toxin test was negative. Stool cultures were negative. Stool microscopy was negative for ova and parasites. Urine cultures revealed Escherichia coli (10,000-49,000 CFU/ml) combined with normal urogenital flora. Blood cultures revealed no growth. Testing for acute hepatitis A, B and C viruses was negative. Epstein-Barr virus serology revealed prior infection. BK virus DNA, Parvovirus B19 DNA and adenovirus DNA were not detected by specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests.\nInfectious diseases service was consulted. Given the presence of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, transaminitis and multi-systemic symptoms, there was concern for an ongoing viral process. She was started on valganciclovir 900 mg PO BID for presumed CMV disease, with intravenous fluid support. The E. coli in the urine was thought to be a colonization and she was successfully monitored off antibiotics.\nShe continued to have persistent fevers and diarrhea, with worsening leukopenia (lowest WBC count 1700/mm3 with lowest ANC 800/mm3), thrombocytopenia (nadir 86,000/mm3) and liver function abnormalities (AST 139 U/l, ALT 135 U/l, ALP 167 U/l). Given the persistent symptoms and worsening laboratory parameters, MMF was discontinued. Serum CMV PCR testing revealed 154,697 IU/ml (5.19 log10 IU/ml) [lower limit of assay detection 60 IU/ml (1.78 log10 IU/ml)]. Gastroenterology service was consulted for worsening liver function abnormalities and they attributed the clinical picture to systemic CMV infection.\nShe had clinical improvement, with improving CMV PCR tests [504 IU/ml (2.70 log10 IU/ml)] after 12 days of antiviral therapy. She was discharged on the twelfth day of hospital stay, with recovery of WBC count to 5,600/mm3 and platelets 147,000/mm3.\nShe was followed up by in the outpatient transplant nephrology and infectious diseases clinics. CMV PCR was negative 60 days after initiation of antiviral therapy and she was restarted on a lower dose of MMF. After the second negative CMV PCR a week later, MMF dose was increased and valganciclovir was decreased to prophylactic dosing. She received valganciclovir for a total of 87 days.

    "question": "An 81-year-old male presented to the clinic with yellowish discoloration of skin and urine for 2 weeks. He denied any fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, melena, hematochezia, or acholic stools. Past medical history was significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease stage IV. He reported recent loss of appetite but denied any significant weight changes. Ultrasound ordered by primary care physician showed intra- and extra-hepatic biliary dilation with distension of gall bladder without cholelithiasis. He was sent to the emergency department (ED) for further evaluation.\nOn examination, blood pressure was 133/60 mmHg, heart rate was 75 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 23 breaths per minute, temperature was 97.7°F, and oxygen saturation was 98% in room air. He had mild icteric sclera, and chronic venous stasis changes in bilateral lower extremities were noted. Bowel sounds were normal, and no hepatosplenomegaly or abdominal tenderness was noted on exam.\nLaboratory investigations showed a hemoglobin count of 11 g/dl, white blood cell count of (WBC) 3800 cell/mm3, and platelet count of 214,000/mm3. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were elevated at 326 and 321 IU/L, respectively. Total bilirubin was 3.1 mg/dl with direct bilirubin of 1.8 mg/dl. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was 1,219 IU/L with lipase 250 IU/L. Renal function tests were at baseline at 1.72 mg/dl (baseline 1.7–1.9 mg/dl). Recent upper and lower endoscopy (1 month earlier) did not show significant abnormalities, except for mild antral gastropathy. A computed tomography (CT) scan of abdomen and pelvis revealed stable pelvic adenopathy with largest lymph node measuring 4.4 × 1.7 cm (which was noted on the earlier CT scan as well). The pancreatic tissue and abdominal vessels appeared normal. With concern for underlying malignancy, a lymph node biopsy was performed. Endoscopic retrograde of cholangiopancreatography revealed distal common bile duct stricture of 3 cm without obstruction, for which a biliary stent was placed. No pancreatic lesions were observed, and biliary brushings were negative for malignancy.\nThe patient returned to the ED two months later; this time with a fever (102°F), nausea, and right upper quadrant pain for 2 days. Complete blood counts revealed elevated white cell count of 18,700/mm3. AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels were within normal limits, and ALP was elevated at 127 IU/L. The CT scan of abdomen revealed intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and gall bladder wall thickening with pericholecystic inflammatory stranding with normal pancreas (). He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics with piperacillin-tazobactam. Urgent surgical decompression with percutaneous drain placement was performed for stent blockage (with re-stent placement) and bile duct stricture from unknown etiology.\nMeanwhile, histopathology from the earlier right iliac lymph node biopsy revealed sinus histiocytic aggregates interlaced with lymphocytes and plasma cells (), majority of cellular constituents being plasma cells, characterized by oval cellular contours and eccentrically located nuclei (); this was confirmed by diffuse immunoreactivity for CD138 (). Chromogenic in situ hybridization for kappa light chain () and lambda light chain () showed a mixture of kappa and lambda-bearing cells (approximate kappa to lambda ratio of 3 : 1); this finding suggested that the plasma cells were reactive in nature, arguing against the possibility of a plasma cell neoplasm. In situ hybridization for EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) was interpreted as negative.\nAs there was no evidence to suggest a lymphoma or a plasma cell neoplasm, a diagnosis of IgG-related disease was considered. Additional immunohistochemistry showed that the plasma cells present expressed predominantly IgG (); of these, the majority (over 60%) were reactive for IgG4 (). Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation showed polyclonal increase in IgG with no monoclonal proteins. Serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G levels were high (3390 mg/dl) with normal IgA and IgM. IgG subclasses were also high with IgG1 of 1800, IgG2 975, IgG3 324, and IgG4 729 mg/dl.\nA diagnosis of IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis was made, and he was started on prednisone 40 mg daily for 6 weeks. A follow-up CT scan of abdomen after a month revealed significant reduction in the size of his pelvic lymph nodes with largest lymph node measuring 1.8 × 0.7 cm (). Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) performed revealed resolution of stricture (). The biliary stent was removed following resolution of the stricture. He remains on prednisone 20 mg daily with close rheumatology follow-up. Rituximab therapy is being considered as a steroid-sparing agent. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 20-year-old nonalcoholic, nonsmoker Nepalese man with no significant past medical history presented to the outpatient department with melena for 10 days. This was associated with fatigue and generalized weakness of the body. He denied any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or recent weight loss. He also gave a history of low-grade fever with an evening rise of temperature for the same duration. It was not associated with chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, runny nose, watery eyes, or sore throat. He had no history of similar illness in the past or any recent sick contacts. His family history was unremarkable.\nVitals on presentation revealed blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg, pulse 120/min, respiratory rate 24/min, and temperature 100.5°F. On physical examination, he was pale and icteric. There were no edema, ecchymosis, or any palpable lymph nodes. Chest auscultation revealed diminished breath sounds over the right infrascapular region. The rest of the systemic examination was normal.\nBlood investigations showed hemoglobin (Hb) 5.3 g/dL and white blood cells (WBC) 5400/mm3 with neutrophils 79% and lymphocytes 18%, and platelets 319 000/mm3. His renal function tests showed urea 4.5 mmol/L and creatinine 95 μmol/L. Liver function test (LFT) showed total bilirubin 66 μmol/L, direct bilirubin 7 μmol/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 23 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 38 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 161 U/L. His lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was elevated to 1450 U/L. Direct Coombs test was positive for antibodies against red blood cells.\nSerologies were negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus. Serological evaluation for antinuclear antibody (ANA), antidouble-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid antibody (ds-DNA), and anti–smooth muscle antibody (ASMA) were negative. Immunoglobulin levels were normal. A presumptive diagnosis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia was made, and the patient was started on oral prednisone 60 mg daily.\nDue to the presenting complaint of melena, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was done, which revealed a peptic ulcer in the first part of the duodenum. A tissue sample was taken during endoscopy, which did not reveal Helicobacter pylori. He was treated with proton pump inhibitors for his peptic ulcer disease.\nMeanwhile, a chest X-ray showed right-sided pleural effusion (Figure ). The pleural fluid analysis showed an exudative pleural effusion with lymphocyte predominance, lymphocyte to neutrophil ratio of 4, and high adenosine deaminase activity (89 units/L). Computed tomography scan (CT) of the chest with and without contrast showed multiple centriacinar nodules giving tree in bud appearance, fibrotic changes in the right upper lobe, and moderate right-sided pleural effusion suggestive of tubercular pathology. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) was not visualized in the microscopic analysis of the sputum. However, due to high clinical suspicion, corroborative pleural fluid analysis and chest imaging findings, he was started on antitubercular treatment with isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.\nFollow-up laboratories showed Hb stable at 5-7 g/dL. Platelet count decreased to 127 000/mm3 at the time of discharge (Figure ). Following discharge on antitubercular medications and prednisone, he was lost to follow up.\nThe patient presented to our clinic after 3 months following an exacerbation of his symptoms after the inadvertent stopping of his prednisone. He presented with increased fatigue, generalized weakness, and jaundice. He had no preceding upper respiratory tract symptoms. Blood investigation this time showed Hb: 4 g/dL, WBC: 6500/mm3, and platelets: 10 000/mm3. LFT showed total bilirubin: 48.05 μmol/L and direct bilirubin: 13.51 μmol/L. LDH was elevated to 851 U/L.\nThe development of thrombocytopenia in a patient with pre-existing autoimmune hemolytic anemia led us to consider the possibility of Evans syndrome as the cause of bicytopenia. He was started on intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g once daily for 3 days, followed by oral prednisone 60 mg daily. However, there was no improvement in his Hb or platelet count. We considered other immunosuppressive therapies like intravenous immunoglobulin, rituximab, and cyclosporine as possible treatment options, but we faced two challenges with their use: fear of reactivation of TB and the prohibitive cost. Eventually, we decided to start him on cyclosporine, given its affordable cost despite the risk of reactivation of TB. He was discharged on oral cyclosporine 10 mg daily for a month. Unfortunately, he was again lost to follow up. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 69-year-old man presented with general malaise, anorexia, and a history of daily alcohol consumption;he was admitted to Hanawa Kousei Hospital. There was no pertinent history pertaining to medical treatment, family, medication, blood transfusion, or allergy. He had been drinking approximately 900 mL of sake daily for the past 49 years, and had a 29 pack-year smoking history. He had bowel movements once or twice daily with no history of habitual laxative use or enemas. On physical examination, he was lucid, had a heart rate of 84/min, blood pressure of 138/66 mm Hg, and a temperature of 36.9°C;there was jaundice and hepatomegaly. Laboratory findings included white blood cells 9,100/μL, red blood cells 366×10\n4/μL, hemoglobin 12.9 g/dL, platelets 15.1×10\n4/μL, total protein 5.4 g/dL, albumin 2.3 g/dL, total bilirubin 5.85 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 4.02 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 185 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 182 U/L, lactate dehydrogenase 526 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 1,312 U/L, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase 1.782 U/L, amylase 42 U/L, blood urea nitrogen 29.4 mg/dL, serum creatinine 1.54 mg/dL, C-reactive protein 6.31 mg/dL, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) 9.7 ng/mL, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) 54 U/mL, and soluble interleukin-2 receptor 510 U/mL. Hepatitis virus markers and autoantibodies were negative. Urine was positive for ketone bodies. A non-contrast CT confirmed hepatomegaly, with no evidence of bile duct obstruction or malignant tumor (). In addition, CT showed localized colonic wall-thickening at the splenic flexure (). We diagnosed the patient as having acute alcoholic hepatitis in light of his drinking history. He had avoided medical checkups previously; on the other hand, he had no other conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, or hyperuricemia, after admission. His clinical symptoms, jaundice, and liver dysfunction rapidly improved with fluid replacement and rest. Non-contrast CT on admission showed colonic wall-thickening at the splenic flexure, and a blood test showed a slight increase in CEA. Since the patient had not previously undergone CS, it was performed to rule out colon cancer on the seventh hospital day. The colonic splenic flexure showed redness over two-thirds of its circumference and an ulcerative, slightly constricted lesion approximately 5 cm in length (). Differential diagnosis included IC, colon cancer, malignant lymphoma, infectious enteritis, and inflammatory bowel disease, but the histopathological findings on biopsy showed only nonspecific inflammatory changes. On the 12th hospital day, contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen revealed a thickened colonic splenic flexure wall. There was no enhancement of the intestinal wall (). Although calcification of the aorta was observed, there was no evidence of calcification or occlusion in the superior mesenteric artery, inferior mesenteric artery, superior mesenteric vein, inferior mesenteric vein, branches, or portal vein. The patient had constipation after initiation of conservative treatment, and malignancy could not be ruled out from the findings of contrast-enhanced CT. On day 30 after starting treatment, a second CS revealed complete circumferential stenosis of the colonic splenic flexure with difficulty in passing the scope through the proximal side (). With gastrografin contrast radiography through CS, full-circumference stenosis to approximately 3 cm was recognized (). Stricture-type IC was suspected based on the first endoscopy and rapid course of circumferential stenosis. Histopathological findings on biopsy showed erosion of the mucosa, edema of the stroma, and infiltration of inflammatory cells, confirming the diagnosis of IC (). Surgery was also considered, but the patient had only mild symptoms of constipation, which were judged not to be indicative of complete intestinal obstruction. Therefore, conservative treatment with oral laxatives and intestinal motion regulators was performed. CEA decreased to 6.0 ng/mL on the 56th hospital day. CS showed scarring and healing of the lesion on the 105th hospital day (), and histopathological findings on biopsy showed no evidence of malignancy. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 65-year-old female with history of chronic alcohol use was hospitalized for sudden onset of hematemesis. She also reported few days of nausea and vomiting associated with worsening ascites. She denied any significant past medical history except for a ruptured ovarian cyst at age of 30 years that required emergent surgery. Patient had a long history of alcohol use (two glasses of vodka daily) for over 10 years. Physical exam showed scleral icterus, there was mild abdominal distention with epigastric tenderness, no hepatosplenomegaly was noted. No signs of encephalopathy or asterixis were seen. Blood test showed hemoglobin 10.4 × 10 g/dL, white blood cell count of 7.7 × 103 cells/µL and platelet count of 190 × 103 cells/µL. Her prothrombin time and international normalized ratio (INR) were elevated at 1.4 and 14.3 s, respectively. Liver function test showed aspartate transaminase 140 U/L, alanine transaminase 29 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 332 U/L, total bilirubin 9.6 mg/dL (direct 7.4 mg/dL, indirect 2.2 mg/dL). Few hours after admission, she developed an episode of hematemesis with drop in hemoglobin to 7.7 g/dL. Emergent endoscopy showed a non-bleeding 2 cm prepyloric gastric antral ulcer (). Biopsy of the ulcer base was negative for malignancy or H. pylori.\nFollow-up endoscopy at an interval of 6 weeks showed a healing prepyloric antral ulcer with mild portal hypertensive gastropathy (). Patient had a repeat endoscopy at 4 months for persistent nausea and vomiting which again showed a healing antral ulcer. She continued to drink alcohol and was intermittently followed by her the primary care physician. She also reported daily NSAID use for abdominal pain and nausea. She had multiple emergency department (ED) visits for the same complaints and underwent repeat endoscopy which showed a duodenal ulcer (). She was managed with pantoprazole twice daily and was advised to avoid NSAIDs and alcohol. She also underwent extensive workup for recurrent nausea and vomiting which were all unremarkable. Systemic disorders including but not limited to neurological cause, adrenal, parathyroid and diabetes were also ruled out.\nShe again presented to the ED for worsening nausea and vomiting associated with upper abdominal pain. Endoscopy, now 7 years from the discovery of the initial lesion, showed a GDF. The prepyloric antral ulcer had fistulized into the duodenal bulb creating the appearance of a double pylorus (). Biopsy of the ulcer base was again negative for malignancy or H. pylori. H. pylori stool antigen and serum H. pylori antibody test were also negative. She was discharged on oral proton pump inhibitor and has been followed up with gastroenterology for management of Laennec’s cirrhosis. With more frequent outpatient follow up, alcohol abstinence and use of acid-suppression medication, she had gradual improvement in her symptoms in about 1 - 2 months.

    "question": "A 22-month-old African-American girl was transferred from an outside hospital to the intensive care unit for further evaluation and the management of uncontrolled severe hypertension. She had a three-day history of fever, cough, rhinorrhea, shortness of breath, dizziness and vomiting. She was born at term with a weight of 2.8 kg and had an unremarkable perinatal course. She had no known genetic syndromes. Besides a history of difficulty gaining weight with a current weight of 10.7 kg (seventh percentile) and a height of the 25th centile, she had no other known medical problems in the past. There was no history of urinary tract infections or blood in urine. She did not have headaches, seizures or fainting episodes. Immunizations were up-to-date. Prior blood pressure (BP) measurements were unknown because they were never obtained. There were no other past hospitalizations. She had not been taking any medications. Family history was unremarkable for kidney disease, hypertension, dialysis or transplantation.\nUpon physical examination, her vital signs were as follows: a temperature of 36.9 °C (98 °F), a respiratory rate of 16 per minute, a heart rate of 145 beats per minute, an oxygen saturation of 100% on room air, and an elevated BP of 200/120 mm Hg (manual, right upper extremity, proper size cuff; 95th percentile value for her age, gender and height 104/62 mm Hg). The examination showed a thin-appearing toddler who was not in obvious distress. The rest of the examination was negative except for tachycardia and a grade II/VI systolic murmur at the apex. A renal bruit was not heard upon auscultation. There was no skin rash or edema. The neurologic examination was normal.\nThe nasal swab for a respiratory viral panel test was positive for parainfluenza 3. Besides mild nasal congestion, she had no cough, difficulty breathing, or wheezing, and she remained stable in room air. She remained afebrile throughout the hospital admission. Her throat culture was negative for beta-hemolytic streptococcus. Her blood culture showed no growth. Her chest x-ray showed mild cardiomegaly but no focal airspace disease, pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Her electrocardiogram showed supraventricular tachycardia. Her echocardiogram revealed a dilated left ventricle with severe concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, with an LV mass index of 187 gm/m2.7 and a mildly depressed LV systolic function with an ejection fraction of 50%. There was a thrombus in the apex of the LV. The serum brain natriuretic peptide and troponin I levels were 1565 pg/mL (normal: <100 pg/mL) and 242 pg/mL (normal: <15 pg/mL), respectively. For possible viral-induced cardiomyopathy, she was started on intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone. For hypertension, she was started on nicardipine infusion, along with nitroprusside with a goal BP reduction of 30% over 24 hours. Milrinone was added for depressed LV systolic function. She remained on the maximum nicardipine infusion rate for several days due to persistent hypertension, with systolic BPs of 140–150 mm Hg. Heparin was transitioned to enoxaparin and aspirin, with the resolution of the cardiac thrombus by day three. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of head showed no mass, acute intracranial hemorrhage, cytotoxic edema, midline shift, or signs of herniation. Her urine output was normal.\nA renal function test showed an initial serum sodium level of 131 meq/L with a nadir of 121 meq/L at day three of admission, a serum chloride level of 97 meq/L (nadir 84 meq/L at day three), a serum potassium level of 3.2 meq/L, a blood urea nitrogen level of 25 mg/dL, and a serum creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL. Her fasting blood glucose level was 90 mg/dL. Her urine sodium level was 89 mmol/L with a fractional excretion of sodium of 1.5%. Her serum albumin level was between 2.1 and 2.5 gm/dL, and her random urine protein to creatinine ratio was 4.6 (normal: <0.2). There was no microscopic hematuria. Her urine culture showed no growth. Her blood counts and serum complements were both normal. Her sickle cell screen was negative. A renal sonogram showed a small right kidney of 6 cm in length (36th centile) and a left kidney of 7.7 cm in length (96th centile), with good blood flow in both kidneys. Her serum aldosterone and plasma renin activity at the time of admission were both elevated at 106 ng/dL (normal: <16 ng/dL, supine, quantitative chemiluminescent immunoassay) and >150 ng/mL/h, respectively (normal: 1.7–11.2 ng/mL/h, supine, quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; both ARUP laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT, USA).\nA work-up for possible catecholamine-secreting tumors due to severe hypertension included the evaluation of urine and serum catecholamines. Her 24-hour urine normetanephrine, metanephrine, vanillylmandelic acid, and homovanillic acid levels were 1525 µg/g of creatinine (normal: 0–1300 µg/g of creatinine), 433 µg/g of creatinine (normal: 0–530 µg/g of creatinine), 10 mg/g of creatinine (normal: <16 mg/g of creatinine), and 12 mg/g of creatinine (normal: <25 mg/g of creatinine), respectively. Her serum fractionated catecholamines showed the following: an epinephrine level of 152 pg/mL (normal: 36–640 pg/mL) and a norepinephrine level of 1964 pg/mL (normal: 68–1810 pg/ml), respectively. Given a less than two-fold increase from normal range of serum norepinephrine, the suspicion of the presence of a neuroendocrine tumor was low.\nA diuretic nuclear renogram showed asymmetrical renal function with decreased blood flow and function in the small right kidney relative to the left. Her differential function was 70% in the left and 30% in the right. There was a normal uptake of the technetium-99 m MAG3 (mercaptoacetyltriglycine) with prompt excretion from the left kidney. Her right kidney had little delayed uptake with prompt excretion ( and , ). A duplex sonogram of her RA showed focal elevation in velocity in the proximal right main RA (peak systolic velocity (PSV): 405 cm/second) with a decreased velocity in the mid and distal RAs (PSV: 117 and 110 cm/sec, respectively). The renal aortic ratio (RAR, the ratio of renal to aortic PSV) was elevated at 3.2. Additionally, distinct “tardus-parvus” (tardus-slow and late, parvus-small and little) waveforms were seen at the right hilar and interlobar arteries. This combination of an elevated PSV at the proximal right main RA along with an elevated RAR (usual cut-off 3) and abnormal waveforms was highly suggestive of proximal right main RAS. Velocities in the left main RA were normal with no differences at various segments of the main artery. A CT angiogram (CTA) of the RAs showed a small right kidney of 6 cm in length with a decreased enhancement of the superior pole of the right kidney. The origin of the right main RA was diminutive compared to the left. There was a homogenous enhancement of the left kidney with a normal appearing left RA. Hypertension at that time was well controlled with amlodipine, clonidine, furosemide, spironolactone and labetalol. Nicardipine infusion was discontinued at day seven of admission.\nA few days later, she underwent a digital subtraction angiogram (DSA), which showed a beaded appearance of the right proximal main RA, which caused a focal stenosis with post-stenotic dilatation ( and ). The pressure gradient across the stenotic lesion was 40 mm Hg. There was normal renal parenchymal perfusion. The left RA demonstrated a normal appearance of the main and branch arteries with normal renal parenchymal perfusion and no evidence of stenosis and irregularity. A diagnosis of right RA stenosis, most likely due to focal FMD, was made. In conjunction with vascular surgery and intervention radiology, it was collectively decided not to pursue the intervention of the stenotic lesion due to the risk of complication, specifically the injury or dissection of the right RA, especially because her BPs were relatively controlled on five antihypertensive agents. Subsequent to the angiogram, enalapril was added once bilateral RA stenosis was excluded for optimal BP control. A CTA of the head and neck vessels to look for evidence of FMD in the head and neck showed a normal vasculature of the vessels. Baby aspirin was started to prevent thromboembolic events.\nThough fever, parainfluenza virus infection, and LV thrombus could have partly contributed to the elevated BPs initially, these signs and symptoms had resolved at the time of or soon after admission. Additionally, the finding of a discrete anatomic lesion in the right RA that is known to cause hypertension suggests that the right RA FMD indeed was the most probable cause of the severe, long-standing hypertension, as suggested by the severe concentric LV hypertrophy. At the time of discharge two weeks later, her BPs were relatively optimal (105–110 mm Hg SBPs) on enalapril, amlodipine and labetalol. Subsequent monthly clinic follow-up visits seven months later have shown stable SBPs with no clinical symptoms of hypertension. Her renal function has remained stable with normal serum electrolytes without hyponatremia and hypokalemia. Her proteinuria has resolved. A follow-up echocardiogram showed normal LV systolic function and stable but persistent LV hypertrophy with no reappearance of the thrombus that was seen in the first echocardiogram. For now, we plan to closely follow-her BPs, along with a follow-up diuretic renogram and a DSA in a few months, with a tentative plan for either continued medical treatment or surgical intervention (angioplasty with or without stent and surgical revascularization or right nephrectomy) based on the clinical course.

    "question": "The patient is a 35-year-old lady presented to the primary care physician with the chief complaint of cough. Her past medical history is significant for a possible tuberculosis infection 15 years ago. She was in direct contact with another patient who was positive for tuberculosis at a gathering event and later completed a six-month course of anti-tuberculosis regimen prescribed by her primary care physician. She otherwise remained to be asymptomatic and healthy. Her nonproductive cough began three weeks ago. She denied fever, chest pain, dyspnea, night sweats, and weight loss but did complain of sore throat and occasional chills. She lived at home with her family and reported to have sick contact with her kids as they were suffering from an upper respiratory infection. She decided to present to the office for further evaluation due to concerns about possible tuberculosis reactivation.\nHer initial vital signs on presentation were as follows: blood pressure 116/59 mmHg, heart rate 81 beats per minute, temperature 97.8°F, body mass index 20.97. Physical examination was completely benign. There was a low clinical suspicion of active tuberculosis given her overall clinical impression. She was recommended to follow up in the clinic in a few weeks after obtaining a two-view chest x-ray (CXR), sputum acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear, and culture. The patient was followed up via telemedicine over the next few weeks. She continued to have a mild cough with a low clinical suspicion for tuberculosis. The AFB smear and culture could not have been completed due to a lack of sputum samples. CXR revealed small rim calcified lesions in the right mid and upper lung zones suggestive of a benign etiology without findings of active or latent tuberculosis infection (Figure ). The patient was recommended to schedule a follow-up appointment in six months while maintaining a close observation of her symptoms.\nSix months later, her cough reoccurred after an initial improvement over the past few months. The cough was accompanied by occasional sputum. She denied fever, chills, night sweat, sore throat, chest pain, dyspnea, or weight loss. She had been in close contact with people who were diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection. She was recommended to undergo a pulmonary function test (PFT) as well as a chest CT for further evaluation. She was prescribed dextromethorphan for symptomatic relief, educated on the symptoms of active tuberculosis, and instructed to give frequent updates of her symptoms. CT with intravenous contrast revealed a high right paratracheal and medial right apical heterogeneous soft tissue with central areas of calcification (Figure ). She agreed to opt for a routine endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) to rule out malignancy.\nBronchoscopy inspection revealed unremarkable trachea, left upper lobe, left lingula, left lower lobe, right middle lobe, and right lower lobe; but interestingly, no right upper lobe was observed. Furthermore, EBUS-TBNA showed a right paratracheal mass without surrounding lymphadenopathies that was biopsied and sent to pathology for analysis. The presumptive diagnosis for the right paratracheal mass was likely due to a nondeveloped right upper lung with associated scarring and atelectasis. The pathology report later confirmed the finding as there was no indication of malignancy or fungal infection. What is the patient's Centor Score?",

    "question": "In March 2015, a 45-year-old Korean woman presented to our emergency department (ED) with shortness of breath and an episode of seizure. Five hours before arriving in the ED, she developed a tonic-clonic seizure for 30 seconds and a high temperature of 40℃. The patient had preceding upper respiratory infection 4 days before coming to the ED. She also complained of severe coughing productive of blood-tinged sputum, and generalized myalgias. Her past medical history was unremarkable except for recurrent (one or two per year) epileptic seizures with oral phenytoin maintenance for 25 years. She had no known allergies. She did not receive the seasonal influenza vaccine.\nOn physical examination, the patient's blood pressure was 91/59 mmHg, and she had tachycardia (114/min), tachypnea (32/min), and a temperature of 37.9℃. She looked acutely ill, but was mentally alert. Examination of her lungs revealed coarse crackles throughout bilaterally. Other findings were unremarkable. A chest radiograph showed cardiomegaly and bilateral patchy consolidations. An electrocardiogram revealed low QRS voltage in the precordial leads (the entire QRS-complex amplitude was <8 mm). Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH of 7.38, carbon dioxide tension of 27.7 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen of 59.8 mmHg, bicarbonate level of 16.7 mmol/L, base excess of 6.4 mmol/L, and oxygen saturation level of 90.7%. The patient was given supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula (2 L/min).\nInitial laboratory findings revealed a hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL, white blood cell count of 18.8 × 103/mm3 (neutrophils, 85.6%), platelet count of 504 × 103/mm3, blood urea nitrogen level of 14.9 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein level of 4.92 mg/L (normal range, 0.0-5.0 mg/L). An influenza rapid antigen test on the patient's nasopharyngeal swab sample, which was promptly performed because of residual seasonal influenza activity in the community, was positive for influenza A virus. She was immediately given a single dose (300 mg) of IV peramivir, and levofloxacin, 500 mg/day.\nThe patient's dyspnea worsened, however, and she became hypotensive (blood pressure, 86/53 mmHg). She was managed with increased oxygen supply (4 L/min), furosemide, and norepinephrine (0.125 µg/kg/min). Additional blood tests revealed the following component levels: troponin I, 1.36 ng/mL (normal range, 0.0-0.16 ng/mL); creatine kinase-MB (CKMB), 49.27 ng/mL (normal range, 0.0-3.61 ng/mL); creatine phosphokinase (CPK), 1,585 IU/L (normal range, 38-185 IU/L); lactate dehydrogenase, 937 IU/L (normal range, 238-422 IU/L); N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide, 162.8 pg/mL (normal range, 0-125 pg/mL), and myoglobin, 138.8 ng/mL (normal range, 25-58 ng/mL). Serology for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and HIV were all negative.\nA chest computed tomography scan demonstrated multifocal patch consolidations in both lungs, with ground-glass opacities, suggestive of pulmonary edema or atypical pneumonia. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a depressed left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction of 30%, LV enlargement, diffuse hypokinesia with sparing LV apex, and decreased right ventricular apical wall motion, which was compatible with acute myocarditis ().\nThe patient was clinically diagnosed with influenza A-associated fulminant myocarditis, resulting in pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock, and admitted to the intensive care unit. On day 2 of hospitalization, her hemodynamic state had stabilized and she no longer required norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure within a normal range. A follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram taken on day 3 showed improved ventricular systolic function, with LV ejection fraction at 55% to 60%. Laboratory tests on day 4 revealed a troponin I level of 0.168 ng/mL, CK-MB level of 41.31 ng/mL, and CPK level of 1,459 IU/L. On day 5 of her hospitalization, the patient's dyspnea had improved and supplemental oxygen was stopped. On day 6, she was transferred to a general ward. A follow-up chest computed tomography scan demonstrated improved status of pulmonary edema, with residual, mild bilateral pleural effusion. The patient was discharged with recovery on day 9 after admission. Although her muscle enzyme levels still remained elevated 16 days after discharge (CK-MB, 42.63 ng/mL; CPK, 1,340 IU/L), she had been asymptomatic and carefully observed in the outpatient clinic ().\nMonitoring of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays (Real-Q Flu A, B Detection Kit; BioSewoom Inc., Seoul, Korea) using the patient's nasopharyngeal aspirates showed positivity for both influenza A (threshold cycle value, 27.23) and subtype hH3N2 (threshold cycle value, 27.39) on day 2 (), but became negative by day 4 of the patient's hospitalization.

His FBC was monitored twice daily throughout hospital stay, showed severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia which later complicated by anemia from the 3rd day of hospital stay (Table ; Fig. ). The reticulocyte count was 1.1 % (normal 0.5–2.5). The patient was transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) on the 3rd day and treated with granulocyte colony stimulating factors (G-CSF) 300 µg daily for 10 days. On the 5th day he developed swelling of his left inguinal region with mild skin induration. The initial USS of left groin showed only subcutaneous tissue oedema. This subsequently progressed to an abscess which was drained. His white cell count and platelet count improved with 10 days of treatment with G-CSF. Hemoglobin normalized in 4 weeks of treatment. At this stage his WBC count was 12 × 103/µl with absolute neutrophil count 7200/µl (60 %), hemoglobin 12.6 g/dl and platelets 212 × 103/µl. He was started on conventional antipsychotics without clozapine for his psychiatric condition. What is the patient's Centor Score?",

Two weeks prior, she was found to have bilateral tonsillitis, successfully treated with a 10-day course of amoxicillin before arrival to the ED.\nOn clinical examination, her vitals were slightly abnormal, with a fever of 100.7°F, a corresponding pulse of 104 beats per minute, and an elevated blood pressure at 135/70 mmHg. Neck examination revealed lymphadenopathy. Ears, nose, and throat examination revealed pharyngeal erythema, bilateral tonsillar erythema, bilateral tonsillar exudate, bilateral tonsillar swelling, and a left peritonsillar abscess (Figure ).\nThe patient had an elevated white blood cell count in response to the tonsillar infection (Table ). Head and neck computed tomography scans revealed moderate heterogeneous prominence of the bilateral palatine tonsils with a small tonsillar abscess (15 mm hypodensity on the left) (Figure ).\nAlso noted is an esophageal diverticulum (3.5 cm) and moderate somewhat symmetric bilateral neck lymphadenopathy particular to the submandibular regions with tonsillar abscess (Figure ).\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital, seen by otorhinolaryngology, and treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate.

    "question": "Our patient is a 2-year-old male who presented with a 1-day fever (Temperature: 103.6°F), cough, congestion, and inadequate oral intake. The patient's history was obtained from the patient's mother. She denied any signs of vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, respiratory distress, ear pain, or a sore throat. Additionally, the patient showed signs of dehydration. Upon an initial examination, he was agitated but consolable. An examination of his ears revealed no external deformities; his canals were patent and without inflammation, and his tympanic membranes were intact, gray, translucent, and mobile. His nose showed no external deformities, and the nares were patent. His nasal turbinates were erythematous, but no inflammation was exhibited. His oral structures were normal for a child of his age, and the mucous membranes were moist and pink, without any lesions or exudates. His teeth did not have any dental caries. His neck was supple, and no cervical lymphadenopathy was present. The rest of his physical examination also revealed negative findings. The patient's fever and irritability warranted initial laboratory tests, including a rapid influenza test, a complete blood cell count (CBC), a C-reactive protein (CRP) test, and a blood culture. Abnormal values included leukocytosis that exhibited a left shift (26 500 cells/µL) and an elevated CRP (24.7 mg/L).\nDue to his elevated CBC and CRP, the patient was called back into the office for a re-evaluation the next day. His physical examination revealed new findings of erythematous tonsils with a midline uvula, as well as left and right posterior cervical nodes. The tenderness of the nodes was difficult to decipher because the patient was irritable throughout the examination. The hydration status of the patient had improved from the previous night. The rest of his physical examination revealed similar findings as the previous day. A urinalysis was obtained via catheterization and revealed negative results. Since his elevated WBC count raised concerns of the possibility of a bacterial infection, an intramuscular ceftriaxone injection was given. The patient was sent home with instructions to the parents to report any changes in his symptoms or any reactions to the antibiotics. Subsequent tests for CBC and CRP, which were obtained on the 4th day of the patient's symptoms, were still elevated, although the levels had improved (20 000 cells/µL and 14.6 mg/L, respectively). The patient initially responded well to the antibiotics; however, his fever returned, with a temperature of 103.8°F. He was seen again in the office on the 6th day of his symptoms. At this point, he presented with a new finding of left neck swelling. He had cervical asymmetry, and his left tonsil was deviated toward the midline, due to soft tissue swelling.

    "question": "A 41-year-old female presenting with complaints of fever, chills, and symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection including sore throat and difficulty swallowing for three days arrived at our emergency department in December 2014. The patient did not have vomiting, diarrhea, chest distress, abdominal pain, rash, jaundice, cough, or expectoration. The patient had no history of smoking or alcohol intake, hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease or other chronic diseases, tuberculosis, hepatitis, typhoid fever, or other infectious diseases. In addition, there was no history of trauma, surgery or history of medicine, or food allergies. One month previously, the patient had been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and prescribed methimazole (10 mg BID) and propranolol (20 mg BID) at a local hospital. The patient discontinued the medicine after taking this treatment for ten days and three weeks prior to admission, since she thought that she may be pregnant because of a delayed menstrual cycle.\nThe patient's initial assessment in the emergency department revealed a temperature of 39.9°C, heart rate of 129 beats/min, and blood pressure of 174/76 mmHg. The patient had pharyngeal congestion, bilateral tonsil enlargement, and visible purulent secretions on bilateral tonsils. The patient had a mild hand tremor; however, there was no rash or jaundice. There were normal S1 and S2 sounds in cardiac examination. The patient's abdomen was normal, and no peripheral edema or lymphadenopathy was observed. There was bilateral grade 2 thyroid enlargement. There was no evidence of ophthalmopathy. The results of a neurologic and rheumatic examination were unremarkable.\nThe laboratory findings before antithyroid treatment were as follows: white blood cell count (WBC) and absolute neutrophil count were normal at 5200/μL (reference range, 3500 to 10500/μL) and 2300x/μL (reference range, 1500 to 8000/μL), respectively, with free T3, 16.8 pg/mL (reference range, 1.71–3.71 pg/mL), free T4 3.9 ng/dL (reference range, 0.7–1.48 ng/dL), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.0001 μIU/mL (reference range, 0.35–4.94 μIU/mL) in thyroid function tests.\nThe results from peripheral-blood count tests showed an absolute neutrophil count of zero and a WBC count of 400/μL at admission. Hemoglobin concentration and platelet count were normal at 13.6 g/dL (reference range, 11.5–16.5 g/dL) and 165 × 103/μL (reference range, 100–400 × 103/μL), respectively. C-reactive protein level was markedly elevated at 155 mg/L (reference range, 0–5 mg/L). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 18 mm/h (reference range, 0–10 mm/h). Thyroid function tests were as follows: free T3, 3.63 pg/mL (reference range, 1.71–3.71 pg/mL), free T4 2.2 ng/dL (reference range, 0.7–1.48 ng/dL), and TSH, 0.0001 μIU/mL (reference range, 0.35–4.94 μIU/mL). The pregnancy test was negative. Results from the electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Chest radiography divulged no infiltration. An abdominal ultrasonography was unremarkable. A peripheral-blood smear was normal except for agranulocytosis. There were no pathological findings except for borderline anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) positivity in rheumatic, viral, and bacterial serological tests (). Based on these results, the patient was diagnosed with ATD-induced agranulocytosis, acute tonsillitis, and hyperthyroidism.\nOn admission to our hospital, the patient was given intravenous antibiotics (amikacin and imipenem) to control infection and propranolol to hinder T4 transformation into T3 and to prevent excitatory effects on the heart. Methimazole was not restarted because of the neutropenia. After three days the neutrophil count increased to 600/μL, after six days the neutrophil count increased to 700/μL, and after seven days the neutrophil count increased to 2600/μL. After 10 days of treatment, a blood culture yielded no microbes, the neutrophil count was increased to 2900/μL, and the patient's symptoms were generally improved; the patient no longer had fever or throat symptoms. With clinical improvement of her symptoms and recovered neutropenia, antibiotherapy was discontinued.\nResults from the thyroid ultrasonography showed bilateral parenchymal heterogeneity, increment blood supply, and a 16 mm solitary nodule in the right thyroid lobe. On thyroid scintigraphy, there was diffusely increased radioiodine uptake in the thyroid gland and a hypoactive nodule in the right lobe. Fine needle aspiration biopsy performed at two different times on the nodule was insufficient. The option of surgical treatment was agreed upon because possible thyroid malignancy could not be ruled out due to inadequate biopsy results. In January 2015, she received a bilateral total thyroidectomy for surgical treatment after obtaining euthyroidism with combination therapy including lugol solution, corticosteroid, cholestyramine, and propranolol. The results of surgical histopathology were consistent with a benign nodular hyperplasia. The patient was followed with levothyroxine replacement treatment and the absolute neutrophil count remained within the reference range at 1600 to 3600/μL. What is the patient's Centor Score?",

    "question": "A 65-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hypothyroidism presented to the emergency department (ED) with shortness of breath which was progressively worsening two days prior to presentation. She also reported having a fever with a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius ( ͦC), chills, and nonproductive cough in the last two days. The patient denied exposure to sick contacts, recent travel outside the state, or recent immobilization. Her temperature on admission was 39 ͦC, blood pressure 132/80 mmHg, heart rate 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 per minute. Physical examination was significant for lethargy, bilateral rales on auscultation of lung fields. Her oxygen saturation was 88% while on 5 liters per minute delivered through nasal cannula so she was placed on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. Chest X-ray showed bilateral interstitial opacities consistent with viral pneumonia. The patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Laboratory results at the time of admission are presented in Table .\nShe was started on remdesevir and dexamethasone as per institutional guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19 viral pneumonia. A 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 120 per minute, so anticoagulation was started with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) 1mg/kg dosing twice daily and rate-controlling medications were administered. 12 hours after admission to the hospital, right arm motor drift, facial droop, and dysarthria were noted. National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 3. Emergent CT of the head revealed age indeterminate lacunar infarct in the left basal ganglia, with no intracranial hemorrhage. CT perfusion study of head and neck showed occlusion of the supraclinoid segment of the left internal carotid artery (ICA) with occlusive thrombus extending into the proximal left anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) (Figure ).\nLeft ACA opacified via an anterior communicating artery. Corresponding large 126 ccs of ischemic penumbra involving the left frontal, temporal and parietal lobes, basal ganglia were also seen. Anticoagulation was switched from LMWH to unfractionated heparin (UFH) in anticipation of the revascularization procedure. The case was discussed with an Interventional neurologist and the decision was made not to proceed with revascularization due to low NIHSS. While the patient was being monitored in the stroke unit, on day 3 of admission, she developed new right-sided hemiplegia, aphasia with altered mentation. The emergent CT of the head showed an increasing size of the infarct within the left basal ganglia and corona radiata. CT perfusion showed stable left ICA/MCA occlusion, however, due to progressive symptoms she underwent emergent left ICA/MCA thrombectomy. The weakness improved after revascularization with an increase in muscle strength from 1/5 to 3/5 in both right upper and lower extremities. UFH was discontinued due to an elevated risk of bleeding post revascularization.\nOn day 7 after the procedure, anticoagulation was restarted with LMWH due to coexisting atrial fibrillation and COVID-19 infection. At this point, the patient completed a 10-day course of remdesevir and dexamethasone and was saturating well with 3 liters per minute supplemental oxygen through the nasal cannula. two days after restarting anticoagulation, a stroke code was called due to sudden onset, left lower extremity weakness. CT perfusion of head and neck demonstrated new distal left M2 branch occlusion within the Sylvian fissure. Mural thrombi were noted in the distal aortic arch and descending aorta. A complete angiogram of the chest and abdomen was done to determine the extent of clot burden. CT angiogram of the chest confirmed the presence of mural thrombus (Figure ).\nAlong with that, a large filling defect was noted within the right interlobar pulmonary artery with extension into the right middle and lower lobe pulmonary artery as well as segmental and subsegmental branches of the right lower lobe compatible with pulmonary embolism (Figure ). CT angiogram of the abdomen showed thrombus in left common femoral artery extending into proximal internal iliac as well as left external iliac arteries (Figures , ). There is a reconstitution of flow within both arteries distally. Platelets dropped from 174 to 63 within few days after restarting anticoagulation (Figure ). 4T score for screening of HIT was 6 (2 each for greater than 50% drop and nadir >30, timing within 5-10 days of exposure and new thrombosis). LMWH was switched to argatroban infusion. Platelet factor 4 antibody test and serotonin release assay test (SRA) were positive (Table ).\nThe patient underwent a left lower extremity angiogram by vascular surgery and treated with tissue plasminogen activator catheter-directed thrombolysis (tPA-CDT). Revascularization was successful with three-vessel runoff and dopplerable pulses in the left lower extremity. Anticoagulation was subsequently switched to apixaban. The patient recovered from COVID-19 and was discharged to the nursing home for rehabilitation for stroke. What is the patient's Centor Score?",

Due to refractory nausea and vomiting she was also put on intravenous metoclopramide, 10 mg three times a day. A few minutes after administration of the second dose of metoclopramide, she complained of pain and stiffness of the neck and an inability to keep her tongue in her mouth. On examination, she was conscious and anxious with a blood pressure of 124/78 mmHg, pulse rate of 90 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths/minute and temperature of 37.3 °C. Her neck was slightly arched backwards and her tongue was hanging out. There was no accumulation of saliva in her mouth and she could swallow, but with difficulty. There were no signs of respiratory distress. The rest of her examination was unremarkable. A diagnosis of metoclopramide induced acute dystonic reaction was made. She was administered 8 mg of oral chlorpheniramine. Her dystonic symptoms subsided 4 h later, as did the nausea and vomiting. She continued her antimalarial treatment and the metoclopramide was discontinued. She did not have any further dystonic symptoms.

She experienced similar symptoms 1, 2, and 9 months ago, and in each case, these symptoms lasted for approximately 5 days regardless of therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or antibiotics. There was no remarkable family history except for her mother's neuromyelitis optica. Her menstrual period was regular. She had taken no drugs except for multi-ingredient cold medication prescribed by a local clinic. She had never traveled abroad.\nOn admission, her body temperature was 37.7°C, and her other vital signs were within the normal ranges. On physical examination, aphthous stomatitis, enlargement of the bilateral submandibular lymph nodes with tenderness, pharyngeal erythema, and enlarged palatine tonsils with white exudates were observed (Figure ).\nLaboratory investigations revealed slightly elevated serum transaminase (aspartate aminotransferase level, 112 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase level, 92 IU/L) and immunoglobulin D (29.1 mg/dL) levels. Bacterial cultures from a throat swab and blood sample showed no growth. Anti-Epstein-Barr virus capsid antigen immunoglobulin G and M titer were order of 160 and under the order of 10. Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen was not investigated. Computed tomography revealed enlargement of the bilateral submandibular lymph nodes with no evidence of other abnormal findings. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed no vegetations. The patient refused to undergo genetic examination.\nThe patient was diagnosed with PFAPA syndrome based on two clinical diagnostic criteria. She satisfied five of six items in Padeh's diagnosis criteria: monthly cyclic fever in any age group, possible aphthous stomatitis, cervical lymphadenitis, exudative tonsillitis with negative throat culture, completely asymptomatic during intervals, and rapid response to glucocorticoid. She also fulfilled four of five items in Thomas’ criteria: regularly recurring fever under 5 years old; presence of at least one of these symptoms, aphthous stomatitis, cervical adenitis, or pharyngitis, without upper respiratory infection; exclusion of cyclic neutropenia; completely asymptomatic during intervals; normal growth and development. Her diagnosis was confirmed with no evidence of other possible febrile diseases.\nAfter admission, her symptoms recovered within a few days without any treatment. We prescribed cimetidine 800 mg per day to prevent recurrence. Although the aphthous stomatitis and enlarged cervical lymph node appeared a few days per month, none of the other symptoms were observed again. Moreover, the aphthous stomatitis has also stopped occurring 5 months after starting cimetidine therapy (Figure ). What is the patient's Centor Score?",

    "question": "On January 31, 2018, a usually healthy, 9-year old, non-Hispanic white female was screened for ORCHARDS eligibility (Figure ). She was a vaccinated (quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine on October 9, 2017) 4th-grade student who lived with both parents and two younger siblings. All family members had received the 2017/2018 influenza vaccine. A home visit was conducted 25 hours after symptom onset. Her moderate ILI was characterized by fever (measured temperature = 37.2°C after antipyretic), chills, cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, headache, malaise, myalgia, anorexia, and sneezing. There was no recent travel, exposure to farm animals, or identified sick contact preceding onset. Nasal and oropharyngeal specimens were collected. Although the RIDT result was negative, rRT-PCR was positive for influenza A (H3N2) (cycle threshold value [Ct] = 31.48) and RPP was positive for coronavirus HKU1. At follow-up, she reported 2 days of absenteeism and continued cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat, myalgia, and headache. There had been no medical follow-up or antiviral treatment. The rRT-PCR result from the subject's day 7 swab was negative for influenza. No other family members reported illness on day 0, but one sibling developed mild respiratory illness on day 6. All family members tested negative for influenza by rRT-PCR on day 0 and day 7.\nOn March 9, 2018, 37 days after the initial encounter, the subject was again screened due to a new ILI episode. A home visit was conducted 49 hours after symptom onset. Now 10 years old, the subject complained of significant symptoms including fever (measured temperature = 37.6°C after antipyretic), chills, cough, wheezing, nasal congestion, headache, malaise, myalgia, anorexia, burning eyes, and dizziness. Again, there was no recent travel, exposure to farm animals, or identified sick contact preceding onset. The subject's RIDT result was positive for influenza A, and rRT-PCR results confirmed the presence of influenza A (H3N2) (Ct = 26.48). At follow-up, she reported 2 days of absenteeism and continued fever, chills, cough, rhinorrhea, malaise, myalgia, headache, and anorexia. There had been no medical follow-up or antiviral treatment. The rRT-PCR results from the subject's day 7 swab continued to show influenza A (H3N2) (Ct = 33.30). No other family members reported illness on day 0 or day 7. All family members tested negative for influenza by rRT-PCR on day 0 and day 7.\nThe subject's initial specimen from each episode, collected on January 31 and March 9, 2018, was prepared for full genomic sequencing at the WSLH. Both A (H3N2) strains were of the hemagglutinin gene clade 3C2.a2. After WSLH performed a consensus sequence comparison between the two viruses collected from the subject, three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified within the coding region of the HA protein. Only one SNP was non-synonymous and resulted in an isoleucine to leucine change at position 67 (in HA1). This particular polymorphism was near 100% frequency in the sequence reads and was four amino acids away from an established antibody epitope site (Site E). Both sequences (first isolate ORCH00001 and second isolate ORCH00002) were submitted to the GenBank® genetic sequence database and given accession numbers (MK262897 and MK262898, respectively).

    "question": "Subject 1 (S1), a 54-year old Chinese man, was well until 19 August 2006 when he developed sudden onset of high fever with chills and rigor. This was associated with cough, sore-throat and headache. There was no associated dyspnoea, tachypnoea, haemoptysis or chest pain on coughing. Besides the severe frontal throbbing headache, he had generalized body aches, myalgia and severe malaise. On the following day, he developed nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. The vomitus consisted of food taken and was not bile-stained. The stool was described as watery without excessive mucous and it was non-malenic. The gastrointestinal symptom was associated with abdominal pain and loss of appetite. His illness was not relieved with self-medication of antipyretics. On review, there was no associated giddiness, blurring of vision, photophobia, skin bleeding or arthritis.\nHe sought medical treatment at the government health clinic in Kampar on 21 August 2006. At the outpatient clinic, he was noted to be febrile (an axillary temperature of 40.1 degree Celsius), ill-looking with a generalized body erythema that blanched on pressure and was more prominent over the face and upper trunk. He had mild conjunctivitis but there was no jaundice. His tonsils were enlarged and injected but there was no white exudate noted over the tonsils. He was not in any respiratory distress and his lungs were clear with good air entry on auscultation. Other systemic examination was essentially normal and there was no significant lymphadenopathy noted. A provisional diagnosis of influenza-like illness was made at which he was given a higher dose of anti-pyretic. His illness was noted to resolve on 23 August 2006 although he still appeared weak and lethargic.\nVenous blood samples were taken from the patient for full blood count analysis, and the results are shown in . These results indicated that his white blood cell and platelet counts were within normal limits although there was a relative lymphopenia in the blood sample taken at first examination.\nHis throat swab was taken on August 21 for virus isolation as described below.

    "question": "A 45-year-old male was admitted to our hospital due to substernal chest discomfort on mild exertion, which occurred three weeks prior to presentation. The frequency and severity of his angina increased over time and the patient described a squeezing chest pain with an onset three days prior to presentation. The past medical history included hypertension, diagnosed three years ago, and smoking history of ten pack-years. There was no family history of coronary artery or hematologic disease. At the time of admission he was on aspirin and anti-hypertensive medications. On physical examination, the blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg and the heart rate was 70 beats per minute. The heart sounds were unremarkable with normal S1 and S2 sounds. The lungs were clear on auscultation. The electrocardiogram showed no ST-segment change, T wave inversion or pathologic Q waves suggestive of myocardial ischemia. No abnormality was found on chest roentgenogram. On complete blood count, the hemoglobin was 13.9 g/dL, white blood cell count was 9,400/L, and the platelet count was 106×104/µL. Electrolytes, renal and liver function tests were not remarkable. Levels of CK-MB and Troponin-T were within normal range. Total serum cholesterol was 161 mg/dL, triglyceride was 95 mg/dL and high-density lipoprotein was 39 mg/dL. Serum homocystein level was 12.7 nmol/mL (reference range 5-15 nmol/mL), and hsCRP was 1.91 mg/L (reference range <3 mg/L). Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and fibrinogen level were within normal range. The iron profile was not remarkable. Bone marrow study showed a hypercellular marrow with markedly increased megakaryocytes, and a normal myeloid/erythroid ratio (). Chromosomal analysis of bone marrow cells revealed a normal 46, XY karyotype with no evidence of bcr/abl rearrangement. Liver and spleen were not enlarged on sonogram images. An elective coronary angiography, two days after admission, showed total occlusion at the mid right coronary artery (RCA) with well-developed collaterals from proximal RCA to PD and PL branches. In addition, there was diffuse irregular, up to 70%, luminal narrowing with haziness noted at the proximal RCA. The left coronary angiography showed a 40% luminal narrowing at the mid left anterior descending artery (LAD). The echocardiography, performed three days after admission, showed no regional wall motion abnormality with about 60% of left ventricular ejection fraction. On color Doppler imaging, there was no significant valvular stenosis or regurgitation noted. There was a relaxational abnormality observed in the diastolic filling pattern. The patient was taking aspirin 100 mg/day, clopidogrel 75 mg/day, atenolol 25 mg/day, diltiazem 90 mg/day and nicorandil 15 mg/day from the day of admission. The chest pain was controlled by medical treatment; therefore, we decided to postpone coronary artery intervention until the platelet count reached a normal level. Treatment with hyroxyurea 500 mg/day and anagrelide HCl 1 mg/day was started as cytostatic therapy. The platelet count was normalized (23×104/µL) five weeks after initiation of cytostatic therapy, and coronary artery intervention was then performed. The totally occluded mid RCA lesion was thought to be a chronic total occlusion because of the presence of good collateral flow from the proximal RCA. We thought that the proximal RCA, stenotic lesion with haziness, resulted from a plaque rupture resulting in an occlusive thrombus, and caused the ischemic symptoms that the patient presented with. Two coronary stents were placed at the proximal and mid RCA. No residual stenosis was observed after the procedure (). The LAD lesion was not treated. The patient was discharged two days after the procedure without any hemorrhagic or thrombotic complication; he remained on aspirin, clopidogrel, hydroxyurea, and anagrelide. The patient was free of symptoms for six months during the follow-up period, and his platelet count remained within normal range. What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

He had been admitted to our hospital 3 times previously due to acute pancreatitis with hyperlipidemia. He had type 2 diabetes mellitus and active pulmonary tuberculosis. He was treated with dietary restriction, daily NPH insulin injection, and lipid lowing medication such as fibrate derivatives. His father was noted to have hypertension, old cerebral infarction and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His mother had hyperlipidemia (type IV) and his elder brother had recurrent acute pancreatitis and diabetes mellitus. He didn't have xanthoma or xanthelasma. He had no alcohol drinking history and no biliary calculus disease. His height was 176 cm and weight was 87 kg, showing marked obesity. On physical examination, his abdomen was slightly distended with hypoactive bowel sounds and he had direct tenderness on epigastrium without rebound tenderness. On admission, laboratory data showed white blood cell count of 15,210/mm3. Blood chemistry tests revealed fasting blood sugar level of 228 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase level of 379 IU/L, and aspartate aminotransferase level of 20 IU/L. The serum amylase level of 160 mg/dL was slightly higher than the normal range (25~125 mg/dL). Serum lipase level was increased to 1596 U/L (normal range of 13~60 U/L). Serum calcium level and blood urea nitrogen level were within normal limits. The lipid profiles such as total cholesterol, triglyceride, high density cholesterol and low density cholesterol were 272 mg/dL, 605 mg/dL, 28 mg/dL and 98 mg/dL, respectively. A diagnosis of type IIb hyperlipoproteinemia was made based on serum lipoprotein electrophoresis [0% of chylomicron (0-2.0), 62.9% of β-lipoprotein (36.5-59.1), 22.5% of pre-β-lipoprotein (3.8-33.8), and 14.6% of α-lipoprotein (20.4-46.4)]. Hemoglobin A1c level was 10.4% and fasting C-peptide and postprandial C-peptide were 2.7 and 3.7 ng/mL, respectively. Abdominal CT scan revealed diffusely enlarged pancreas, peripancreatic fat infiltration and pelvic ascites, which were compatible with acute pancreatitis grade C (). He was treated with dietary restriction, hydration, NPH insulin injection and lipid lowering agents. For the purpose of distinguishing infective pancreatitis from hyperlipidemic pancreatitis, we prescribed antibiotics (2 g of meropenem® per day) for two days until abdominal CT information was obtained. His abdominal pain was resolved within a few days, and white blood cell count was normalized. He was discharged after 8 days, with complete recovery from acute pancreatitis.

The patient took no drugs in the past 6 months. On clinical examination, his pain was reported to be 5/10 according to the visual analogue pain scale, he was afebrile, with a maximum temperature of 36.6°C, and had ortho-arteriotony, with a blood pressure of 128/85 mmHg, and no tachycardia or bradycardia (pulse rate of 66 beats per minute). The patient’s face was bloated, but there was no jugular venous distention, muffled breath sounds, rhonchi or moist rale, the third or fourth heart sound gallop, pericardial rub, peritoneal irritation, hepatosplenomegaly, or leg oedema. Electrocardiogram on admission showed that ST elevated to 0.1–0.2 mv in II, III, aVF, and V4–V6 ().\nInitial abnormal serum laboratory results were as follows: troponin I, 3.499 ug/L; myoglobin, 1200 ug/L; creatine kinase-MB, 69 U/L; creatine kinase, 678 U/L; lactate dehydrogenase, 343 U/L; cholesterol, 6.43 mmol/L; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 5.02 mmol/L; glucose, 2.44 mmol/L; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 0.76 mmol/L; prothrombin time, 10.3 s; activated partial thromboplastin time, 24.5 seconds; serum total protein, 39.1 g/L; albumin, 20.2 g/L; and 24-hour urine protein, 11.054 g/24 hours.\nAccording to the results, our preliminary diagnosis was acute inferior myocardial infarction (Killip grade I) combined with nephrotic syndrome, and we performed a percutaneous intervention procedure, which was followed by 300 mg aspirin and 300 mg clopidogrel orally immediately. During the operation, we saw that the left coronary artery had thickened and the left main artery, left circumflex artery, and right coronary artery were normal. However, there was a great deal of thrombi blocking the anterior and middle anterior descending branch, resulting in 95% stricture () and leading to bloodstream classification at thrombolysis and thrombin inhibition in myocardial infarction grade II. Next, we applied the thrombus suction technique and injected 13 ml of tirofiban to dissolve blood clots. Unfortunately, there was still medium thrombi remaining and 60% stricture in the re-examination of coronary arteriography (). The bloodstream classification at thrombolysis and thrombin inhibition in myocardial infarction grade III. Because the anterior descending branch dilatation made it unsuitable for stent implantation, we had to stop further operation. Next, we gave him a therapeutic regimen of low-molecular-weight heparin for 7 days, 100 mg aspirin per day, and 90 mg ticagrelor twice a day to fight platelet aggregation, and 40 mg atorvastatin per night to remedy hyperlipidaemia persistently.\nOne day after the operation, his postoperative electrocardiogram showed that the elevated ST segments in II, III, aVF, and V4–V6 were down to baseline, and an inverted T wave began to appear in V2–V6 (). An echocardiography performed 3 days after admission showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 48.2%, enlarged bilateral atrium, dilated left ventricle, segmental weak pulse of left ventricular wall, mild regurgitation of bicuspid valve or of tricuspid valve, and the estranged left ventricular cells (). Laboratory tests on the same day showed a higher troponin I of 31.833 ug/L, lower myoglobin of 27.9 ug/L, creatine kinase-MB of 21 U/L, creatine kinase of 74 U/L, and lactate dehydrogenase of 489 U/L. After 4 days, the serum laboratory results showed the following results: troponin I, 6.912 ug/L; myoglobin, 29.5 ug/L; creatine kinase-MB, 17 U/L; creatine kinase, 36 U/L; lactate dehydrogenase, 330 U/L; cholesterol, 2.86 mmol/L; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 1.63 mmol/L; triglyceride, 2.28 mmol/L; and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 0.57 mmol/L. All the related indexes were decreased. On the 14th day after the operation, the patient had a third examination of coronary arteriography, which revealed that there was barely any blockage caused by thrombi in the anterior descending branch and no stricture in the coronary artery ().

    "question": "A 19-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with persistent substernal chest pain\nfor 3 hours after staying up late for 1 week. He had been in good health without\nhypertension, hyperlipemia, or other related diseases.\nAn electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with ST-segment elevation and towering T\nwaves in the V1 to V6 leads () and the cardiac troponin level was 0.248 ng/L (upper limit of normal:\n0.1 ng/L). His left ventricular ejection fraction was 55% and glycated hemoglobin level was\n5.0%. The patient’s lipid levels were as follows: total cholesterol, 3.67 mmol/L; total\ntriglycerides, 1.53 mmol/L; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 0.91 mmol/L; and\nlow-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 2.42 mmol/L. He was diagnosed with acute anterior\nmyocardial infarction. His vital signs on presentation were stable with a pulse of\n88 beats/minute, blood pressure of 145/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths/minute,\narterial blood oxygen saturation of 99% on room air, and temperature of 36.2°C. The current\nevidence did not support the diagnosis of aortic dissection, acute pericarditis, acute\npulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, or digestive tract diseases. Therefore, we carried out\nfollow-up treatment after obtaining the patient’s consent. After he received aspirin 300 mg,\nticagrelor 180 mg, and a bolus of 3000 units of intravenous heparin, he underwent emergency\ncoronary angiography (CAG). CAG showed thrombosis in the proximal left anterior descending\nartery (pLAD), and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) thrombus grade 4 and TIMI\ngrade 1 distal flow (),\nbut a normal circumflex artery and right coronary artery. A bolus of heparin (3500 IU) and a\nglycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist (tirofiban) was administered, and a 6F BL3.5 guide catheter\n(Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted, followed by repeated manual thrombus aspiration.\nSubsequent CAG showed TIMI grade 3 flow (). After taking into consideration the patient’s age, intracoronary OCT\nwas performed to assess whether more interventions were essential. OCT showed a residual red\nand white thrombus and plaque erosion in the pLAD. The minimal lumen diameter of the pLAD\nwas 1.92 mm, the area was 2.95 mm2, and the area of stenosis was 48% (). Accordingly, stent\nimplantation was avoided for the patient. He was discharged with optimal medical therapy,\nwhich comprised aspirin, ticagrelor, metoprolol, and a statin, for 12 months as recommended\nby guidelines for prevention of secondary coronary events. CAG and OCT 1 month after primary\npercutaneous coronary intervention showed that an organized thrombus remained in the pLAD\nand that a lipid plaque was under the endomembrane with an unbroken fibrous cap and no\nplaque rupture ().\nCholesterol crystals and microphage infiltration were detected. The patient has remained\nasymptomatic and no adverse events were observed during 6 months of follow-up. What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

    "question": "A 32-year old Korean female was admitted with a complaint of edema and pain on the left leg for 2 months. In January 1993, she was diagnosed as SLE at another hospital and manifested gross hematuria, proteinuria, azotemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypocomplementemia, positive FANA, positive anti-ds DNA antibody and positive anti-ENA antibody. In May 1993, she was transferred to Kangnam St. Mary’s Hospital with steroid (prednisolone 1mg/kg) medication. We checked the titer of anticardiolipin antibody (ACA), which was 100 GPL IU/ml and followed up the titer of ACA regularly at 2 months’ intervals and the titer of ACA IgG was persistently elevated. Her parity was 0-0-0-0 and she showed thrombocytopenia (35,000/mm3) and prolonged partial thromboplastin time (59.2 sec, control 27.0 sec). Her clinical features were Antiphospholipid syndrome in SLE and she was treated with baby aspirin 100 mg/day and steroid (prednisolone 1mg/kg) at the outpatient clinic. From April 1994, she suffered from edema and pain on the left leg and was admitted to our hospital in June 1994. On admission, she had polyarthralgia but did not complain of fever, malar rash, photosensitivity, oral ulcer, Raynaud’s phenomenon, xerostomia, xerophalmia and allopecia. On physical examination, her blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg. pulse rate 76 beats per minute, respiration rate 20 per minute and body temperature 36.5°C. There were no pathologic lesions in her eyes, ears, nasal or oral mucosa. Chest auscultation and abdomen palpation revealed no abnormalities and peripheral arterial pulsation was normal. There were no cutaneous vasculitis and abnormal neurologic signs.\nOn laboratory findings, hemoglobin was 10.6 g/dl, hematocrit 32%, white blood cell 8.1×103/mm3 (neutrophil 82%. lymphocyte 10%) and platelet 122×103/mm3. Renal function showed blood urea nitorgen 5.3 mg/dl, creatinine 0.9 mg/dl and 24hr urine protein 6.18 g/day. Urinanalysis showed 0 to 2 white cells and 10 to 20 red cells per high power fields. Lipid profile revealed total cholesterol 170 mg/dl. triglyceride 98 mg/dl and HDL-cholesterol 51 mg/dl. The AST was 16 IU/L. ALT 12 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 229 IU/L, total bilirubin 0.7 mg/dl, total protein 4.1 g/dl and albumin 2.1 g/dl. The prothrombin time was 11.8 sec (control 12.1 sec) and activated partial thromboplastin time 59.2 sec (control 26.6 sec). On immunologic studies, FANA was positive (homogenous pattern, titer 1 : 1280), anti-ds DNA antibody 5 IU/ml, C3 21 mg/dl and C4 15 mg/dl. Rheumatoid factor was negative and ANCA was positive (GS-ANA, titer 1 : 80). Anti-cardiolipin antibody Ig G was 100 GPL IU/ml. Lupus anticoagulant was positive by the Kaolin clotting test. Anti-ENA and anti-Ro antibodies were all negative. The direct and indirect Coombs’ tests were all negative. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 18 mm/hr and C-reactive protein 2.4 mg/l. The immunoglobulin G, A, M levels revelaed 928, 274, 106 mg/dl, respectively. The serum viral hepatitis markers revealed that HBs antigen was negative, HBs antibody positive and HCV antibody negative. Gastrofiberscope showed esophageal varix, grade 2, and gastric fundal varix. Abdominal ultrasonography showed a moderate amount of ascites, moderate splenomegaly and marked coarse increased liver echogenecity. At computed tomography of the abdomen, we could not trace the inferior vena cava at the intrahepatic portion(). Doppler ultrasonography of the left leg showed no thrombosis in the superficial femoral vein and popliteal vein. Inferior and superior venocavograms showed obstructions at the intrahepatic portion of IVC and at both subclavian veins and abnormal collateral vessels were found around the obstructions (, ). We injected Heparin 5,000 units and Urokinase 500,000 units intravenously at the bolus during venocavogram and further thrombolytic therapy (Heparin 5,000 units/day and Urokinase 500,000 units/day continuously all day long) was done for additional two days. We followed the venocavogram to evaluate the extent of thrombosis, compared with pre-thrombolytic therapy, but we could not find any interval change. We decided to give the patient Warfarin 5 mg/day, Prednisolone 1 mg/kg and baby aspirin 100 mg/day and to follow her up at the outpatient clinic. What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

    "question": "In January 2014, a 45-year-old Japanese man was referred to our clinic owing to obesity, daytime sleepiness, and snoring during sleep. His Epworth Sleepiness Scale score was 10 points. He underwent overnight diagnostic polysomnography in February 2014. Upon admission, his height was 178.6 cm, weight was 130.7 kg, abdominal circumference was 122 cm, and BMI was 41.0 kg/m2. Physical examination showed that the thyroid gland was not palpable. His serum levels of creatine kinase and creatinine were elevated at 1581 U/L and 1.46 mg/dL, respectively, while his other laboratory results were as follows: aspartate aminotransferase, 57 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 49 U/L; lactate dehydrogenase, 353 U/L; total cholesterol (TC), 335 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 45 mg/dL; triglycerides (TGs), 211 mg/dL; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 248 mg/dL; fasting blood sugar, 86 mg/dL; glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), 6.1 %; thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), >500 μIU/mL; free triiodothyronine, 1.4 pg/mL; free thyroxine, <0.15 ng/dL; thyroid peroxidase antibody, 10 IU/mL; and thyroglobulin antibody, >4000 IU/mL (Table ). Blood samples were evaluated using routine methods at Sapporo Clinical Laboratory Inc. (Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan). Based on these results, indicating hypothyroidism and thyroglobulin antibody positivity, the patient was diagnosed with severe primary hypothyroidism (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis). His dyslipidemia and impaired glucose tolerance were considered as secondary changes due to primary hypothyroidism and obesity. Because polysomnography showed an apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) of 71.2 events/h (normal, <5 events/h) and a minimal SpO2 of 60 %, he also was diagnosed with severe OSA associated with autoimmune hypothyroidism. Therefore, in the beginning of March 2014, nasal CPAP (ICON+Auto, auto-adjusting CPAP; Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Limited, Auckland, New Zealand; minimal pressure, 4.0 cmH2O; maximal pressure, 18.0 cmH2O) and low-dose levothyroxine (12.5 μg/day) were initiated. Upon initiation of the CPAP therapy, the patient was informed that he would have to continue with the CPAP therapy unless his body weight decreased sufficiently.\nIn April 2014, the patient’s body weight had decreased to 125.2 kg, and post-CPAP polysomnography indicated improved OSA (AHI, 2.8 events/h; minimal SpO2, 88 %). A monthly follow-up visit was scheduled to check his body weight and adherence to CPAP. The memory stick of the CPAP machine showed that he used CPAP for an average of 6 h per night, 6 days a week, and that he had an AHI of approximately 2.0 events/h. In the course of gradually increasing the dose of levothyroxine, the patient reportedly felt better and had recovered from his fatigue and lethargy.\nTo address his weight loss as a priority, an LCD was initiated in July 2014 []. Yamada et al. [] reported the benefits of a non-calorie-restricted LCD with the amount of carbohydrates limited to 70–130 g/day for Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. The patient consumed 50 g of white rice per meal in addition to vegetables, fish, eggs, and meat in the morning and at noon; however, he did not eat rice, noodles, or other carbohydrates at night. In February 2015, the dose of 175 μg/day levothyroxine appeared to maintain a euthyroid state (TSH, 0.75 μIU/mL), and his other laboratory results were within normal limits, including an HbA1c level of 5.3 %, TC level of 194 mg/dL, and TG level of 89 mg/dL.\nFinally, in July 2015, the patient’s body weight reached 98.3 kg, a reduction of 32.4 kg (25 % of his initial body weight), while his BMI decreased from 41.0 to 30.8 kg/m2. Figure shows changes in his body weight and TSH level over time. The patient felt motivated by the prospect of discontinuing the CPAP therapy, and was encouraged by the consistent weight loss at the monthly clinical visits. He also wanted to continue with the LCD because he did not find it difficult. What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration? Please outuput your answer in terms of mg/dL.",

The free fatty acid level was elevated at 671 μEq/L.\nThere were no significant findings on a chest radiograph. An abdominal ultrasound showed moderate fatty liver.\nFor glycemic control, combination therapy of oral medication (metformin 500 mg BID) and lifestyle modification through adjustments in dietary habits was prescribed. We evaluated her dietary and nutritional knowledge and then counseled her to consume regular meals with 70–90 g of protein per day, maintain daily nutritional requirements of approximately 1800 kcal, and eat a low-carb, low-fat diet. She was recommended to modify her habitual preference of salty and spicy foods, reduce her salt intake, track her meals, and attend outpatient monitoring appointments every 1–2 months.\nFor an exercise program, she was instructed to include aerobic and weight exercises that improve muscle strength. She was advised to walk >1 hour at least 5 days per week and visit a health training center for ≥1 hour of strength exercises at least 3 times per week. We measured her height and weight every 2 months, and used InBody720, a type of BIA for accurate assessment of obesity.

Subcutaneous biopsy was performed on suspicion of amyloidosis in the etiology of proteinuria but no sign of amyloidosis was found in the immunohistochemical analysis. Duodenal and rectal mucosal biopsies were performed but amyloid was detected only in the rectal mucosa. The presence of amyloid was confirmed by the appearance of Congo Red and apple-green birefringence and immunohistochemical staining patterns. Thyroid function tests were as follows: Ft3: 2.14 pg/mL (normal, 2.5 to 3.9 pg/mL), Ft4: 1.01 ng/dL (0.61–1.12), TSH: 0.29 μIU/mL (0.34–4.2), anti-thyroid peroxidase (Anti-TPO): 28 IU/mL (0–35), and antithyroglobulin (AntiTG): 110 IU/mL (0–115). On ultrasonography, both thyroid parenchymata were heterogeneous, whereas a 12 × 8 mm heterogeneous, degenerated, mixed nodule was detected in the isthmus and a 13 × 8 mm cystic nodule was detected in the inferior segment of the right lobe. Thyroid scintigraphy revealed low thyroid activity and increased background activity in the thyroid area. Fine needle aspiration of the thyroid gland revealed a 12 × 8 mm mixed nodule with benign cytological results in the isthmus and an 18 mm cystic nodule at the junction of the left lobe with the isthmus. Thyroid scintigraphy was normal. In the follow-up period, total thyroidectomy was performed due to euthyroidism. Pathological analysis revealed amyloid deposition in the entire thyroid gland and deposition of amorphous eosinophilic material between the follicular structures. Amyloid was histochemically stained with PAS and Congo Red stains and was immunohistochemically classified as AA (Figures , , and ). The patient has been followed up for the last 15 months, and he is currently undergoing the treatment of levothyroxine intoxication and is in remission for amyloidosis that developed secondary to ulcerative colitis.

He had a history of hypertension for 18 years and did not take any antihypertensive drugs.\nHe had no family history of similar diseases and denied previous special drug use.\nPhysical examination upon admission revealed the following: The patient was conscious; a body mass index of 21.0 kg/m2; subcutaneous masses in the mandible, back of the neck, abdomen and elbows (Figure ); no signs of moon face, paper skin, hirsutism, or purple stria.\nLaboratory tests showed a total cholesterol level of 92.16 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 35.28 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 37.44 mg/dL, triglyceride level of 20.7 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1c of 5.4% and 24 h urinary albumin was 343.5 mg/d. Thyroid function was in the normal range. His basal cortisol level as well as his 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test were normal. Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus and syphilis were all negative.\nUltrasonography showed diffuse lipomatosis and lymph node echo in the neck in January 2018. The thickest part of the mass in the neck was about 28 mm. In July 2020, ultrasonography showed that the thickest part of the mass in the neck was about 44 mm. Ultrasonography of the elbow suggested that there was a hypoechoic mass between the palmaris muscles on both sides of the elbow, with a range of about 51 mm × 15 mm × 34 mm on the left and 46 mm × 14 mm × 35 mm on the right. The boundary was clear and the internal echo was not uniform, with strong echoes of several fiber spacers, similar to the echoes of adipose tissue. Simultaneously, excessive fat deposition was suggested on the mandible and the abdominal area of the patient by ultrasonic examination. Computed tomography showed diffuse and marked fatty deposits in the subcutaneous superficial fascia space of the neck without internal lesions (Figure ). A breast ultrasound examination showed that both sides of the breast had excessive fat deposition and a flaky strong echo was seen in the deep side of the areola. The left side was about 33 mm × 3 mm × 25 mm and the right side was about 44 mm × 8 mm × 31 mm. The internal lobular structure was disordered, and small hypoechoic areas were seen, but no obvious mass echo and mammary duct expansion was found. What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

    "question": "Case 1 is a 47-year-old male who recalls gradually worsening illness starting around the age of 25 that he partially attributes to poor food choices and opioid use. By the age of 36, he recalls knowing that he had “undeniable, serious illness,” and by the age of 38, he weighed over 400 pounds and suffered from severe sleep apnea, asthma and trouble breathing, eczema, allergies, hypertension (SBP/DBP = 255/155 on 2 medications), high total cholesterol (300 mg/dL), high triglycerides (279 mg/dL), and chronic shoulder and joint pain. He had difficulty moving and completing basic activities of daily living, such as putting on his shoes. He was on a number of medications that cost him approximately USD 7680 out of pocket, annually, while his insurance company paid a total of USD 19,646 for medications in 2009 alone. In addition to seeing a physician at least once every 1–2 weeks for his various conditions, he attended monthly appointments to aspirate fluid from his knees, had multiple visits to the ER, underwent shoulder surgery, and had one ankle reconstruction surgery with a second one imminent. Around 2012, at the age of 38, he decided to pursue gastric bypass surgery; however, his physician did not clear him to undergo the procedure, due to his poor underlying health. This event, combined with the recent deaths of two close family members, is what ultimately prompted him to begin considering lifestyle changes to improve his health. Initially, his approach to change was “going one step further than the day before.” First, he forced himself to simply get up from his chair once, and then twice per day, and then he progressed to being able to go on walks and walk up the stairs. He began researching additional lifestyle changes and watched documentaries, such as Forks Over Knives, which he describes as providing an entirely new perspective on food. He adopted dietary changes that began with a green juice fast followed by calorie restrictions, reducing red meat, and changing from full to lower fat dairy. On 1 January 2013, he adopted a strict, whole-food, plant-based (WFPB) dietary pattern. Thus, what started initially as a set of small lifestyle changes ultimately fostered a completely new lifestyle approach—one where fitness and plant-based eating were the focus. Approximately 6 months into the lifestyle change, Case 1 had lost 150–200 pounds, and although he does not recall his exact numbers, his cholesterol was cut in half, and triglyceride levels were in the normal range. By 2015, his cholesterol was 112 mg/dL and triglycerides were 74 mg/dL. In just 3–4 years, he went from barely standing up from a chair to running his first marathon in May 2016; by 2017, he was completing Ironman competitions and later ran an ultra-marathon. His current laboratory values as of 20 May 2021 include a total cholesterol of 103 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 36 mg/dL, triglycerides 61 mg/dL, non-HDL cholesterol 67 mg/dL, and blood pressure 122/78. Post lifestyle change, he also notes significant improvement in his level of happiness and quality of life, specifically with respect to being able to enjoy time with his family, traveling, and gaining a new outlook on life.\nAside from the possibility of gastric bypass surgery (USD 18,000–35,000) [], Case 1 was a candidate for a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machine for obstructive sleep apnea (USD 1000–3000) [] and a Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator (TENS) machine for pain management (approximately USD 100–500) [] prior to his lifestyle change, highlighting an approximate average savings of USD 28,800 in discreet medical costs potentially avoided. Post lifestyle change, he reports spending only USD 61 per year on medications (B12 injections), as opposed to his previous approximated average spending of USD 7600+ in annual medication costs. Pharmaceutical costs covered by his insurance company decreased from USD 19,000+ in 2009 to USD 122.24 in 2015 and 2016 combined. In addition, his grocery costs are approximately half of what they were prior to his lifestyle change. What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

    "question": "A 22-year-old female was admitted to our hospital with the chief complaint of heavy menstrual bleeding for 10 days. Blood loss was severe, requiring around 4–5 tampon changes per day, and she complained of feeling dizzy and weak. She was unmarried and had no history of similar menorrhagia.\nAbout 10 months earlier she had prolonged menstrual bleeding at that time, but as the menstrual cycle was normal and the bleeding was not very severe, she had not sought gynecological advice. About 3 weeks earlier she had experienced generalized muscle aches and joint pains (especially involving the upper and lower extremities), along with low-grade fever and bleeding from the gums. She had visited a primary healthcare center, where laboratory examination showed thrombocytopenia (50,000 dL) and anemia (6.5 g/dL). Dengue fever was suspected, and she was given a blood transfusion.\nAt our hospital she was initially admitted to the obstetrics and gynecology emergency department because of the severe menstrual bleeding. However, after ultrasound examination ruled out gynecological abnormalities, she was referred to the internal medicine department. On examination, her vital signs were within normal limits, but the conjunctiva was pale, and her hair showed a tendency to fall out easily. Multiple erythematous macules were present on the skin; however, there was no “butterfly rash” on the face. Systemic examination was otherwise normal.\nHemogram showed the following: hemoglobin 11.3 g/dL; hematocrit 36%; MCV 76.4 fL; MCHC 31.4 g/dL; serum iron 45 µg/dL; TIBC 279 µg/dL; transferrin saturation 16%; thrombocyte count 55,200/dL; and leucocyte count 7,310/dL (with normal differential count). Kidney function tests showed normal serum urea and creatinine levels, with eGFR of 129.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 (calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation). The random blood glucose level was 105 mg/dL. The lipid profile showed total cholesterol, 218 mg/dL; low-density lipoprotein 161 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein 27 mg/dL; and triglyceride 150 mg/dL. Liver function tests and serum electrolyte levels were within normal limits. Coagulation function tests showed partial thromboplastin time 9.7 s (11.3); activated partial thromboplastin time 31.8 s (34.7); fibrinogen level 429.9 mg/dL; and D-dimer 0.2 mg/dL. Antinuclear antibody was positive at a titer of 1/1,000, with C3 86.4 mg/dL, C4 15.4 mg/dL, CRP 2.4 mg/dL, and anti-dsDNA 614.5 IU/mL. Lactic acid dehydrogenase was 464 U/L, reticulocyte count 1.42%, immature platelet fraction 6.7%, and serum albumin 3.87 g/dL. Urinalysis showed a large number of erythrocytes, epithelial cells, and amorphous crystals. Proteinuria was present (2+). Total 24-h protein excretion was 1,148 mg. Kidney ultrasound examination was done as a part of routine examination, which revealed bilateral dilatation of the pelvicalyceal systems showing hydronephrosis grade 1 on the left kidney (Fig. ) and grade 2 on the right kidney (Fig. ) without evidence of kidney cyst or stones. Moreover, ultrasound examination on the urinary bladder shows an increased bladder wall thickness (Fig. ).\nBased on these findings, we diagnosed SLE complicated by lupus nephritis and lupus cystitis. Treatment was started with intravenous methylprednisolone (62.5 mg/day; 1.5 mg/kg/day). The vaginal bleeding stopped within 2 days, and the patient's general condition improved. Laboratory parameters also showed good response to corticosteroid therapy. After 5 days of intravenous therapy, the patient was switched to oral methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg/day). She was discharged from hospital on the 8th day, with the advice to continue methylprednisolone at the same dose and she is scheduled for follow-up after 1 month.

The International Prognostic Scoring System score was 3 and classified as high risk group. Following induction chemotherapy with azacitidine until the 16th cycle, the patient achieved complete remission. Chromosome analysis showed hyperdiploid clone with complex karyotypic abnormalities including trisomy 8 (55,XX, +1, +4, del(5)(q13), +6, +8, +9, +10, +14, +21, +22[17]/46, XX[3]).\nThe patient had been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM) 2 years previously. Serum glucose level was controlled without complications such as diabetic retinopathy or nephropathy including microalbuminuria.\nLaboratory test revealed pancytopenia (hemoglobin concentration, 6.0 g/dL; white blood cell count, 2.25×109/L; platelet count, 12×109/L); slightly abnormal serum lipid profile (total cholesterol, 213 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein, 26 mg/dL; triglyceride, 284 mg/dL); normal prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time; and elevated levels of fibrinogen, fibrin degradation product and D-dimer. Thrombolytic therapy and antiplatelet drugs were contraindicated due to thrombocytopenia. Electrocardiography and echocardiography showed no abnormal result.\nOn physical examination, the patient was alert and hemodynamically stable. Her initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 6 (facial palsy 1, right arm motor 4, dysarthria 1). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed scattered acute infarction in the left cerebral deep white matter near primary motor cortex-white matter junction, corona radiata, and angular gyrus. Brain magnetic resonance angiography indicated severe stenosis and/or acute thrombosis of left proximal M1. And, perfusion MRI showed abnormal perfusion with delayed mean transit time (, , ).\nOn the third day of admission, she underwent rehabilitation consult. Manual muscle strength test (MMT) of right arm was grade 1 proximally and grade 0 at wrist; and the strength of right leg was grade 3 at whole lower limb. The patient scored 40 on the Korean version of Modified Barthel Index, suggesting total dependency of activities of daily living (ADL), and exhibited anomic aphasia. On the 27th day of admission, the patient was unable to open her right eye. The result of follow-up MMT was grade 0 at right whole upper limb, grade 1 at right hip and knee, and grade 2 at right ankle. Further radiologic study was not done despite possibility of progression. During the hospitalization period, conservative treatments alone were administered including intravenous hydration, transfusion, antibiotics for the recurrent infection, and bedside rehabilitative therapy. Additional chemotherapy was not possible because of poor general condition. On the 44th day of admission, the patient was transferred to a secondary referral hospital. On the day of discharge, her NIHSS score was 10 (facial palsy 2, right arm motor 3, right leg motor 2, limb ataxia 1, sensory 1, dysarthria 1), which was increased from that on admission.

    "question": "A 53-year-old female presented to our hospital complaining of a 6-month history of backache. Judging from the blood testing results, she had hypercalcemia, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was increased to 1,253 U/L (normal range, 35 to 130); the patient was sent to the endocrinology department. Her past history was significant for a surgical procedure for fibrocystoma of her right humerus 20 years ago, and she had donated one of her kidneys to a relative 7 years previously. She had taken atorvastatin 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, and omega-3 fatty acid 1,000 mg daily for the past 3 years to treat high blood pressure and dyslipidemia. The patient had been misdiagnosed with a thyroid nodule and hypothyroidism at another hospital 4 years previously and had immediately been prescribed levothyroxine 50 µg/day. At that time, the thyroid ultrasonography revealed two nodules that were 0.3 and 0.5 cm in diameter on her right lobe and another nodule that was 2.3×1.3 cm in size that was projected backwards. She had fine needle aspiration cytology for the nodule on the left lobe, and this had revealed a benign nodule. She had been followed up every 6 months by neck ultrasonography. Two years later, when the nodule on the left lobe of the thyroid had increased in size to 2.9×1.7 cm, they carried out radiofrequency ablation. However, the thyroid nodule remained the same size even after the radiofrequency ablation, so they monitored its size every 6 months for 2 more years (). During that time, the patient began experiencing backache and visited the orthopedics department of our hospital where she was suspected of having metabolic bone disease due to the high serum ALP value.\nThe patient presented with generalized weakness and fatigue without other hypercalcemic symptoms. The peripheral blood examination was as follows: leukocyte count, 7,020/mm3; hemoglobin, 9.3 g/dL; platelet count, 249,000/mm3; prothrombin time (PT), 14.4 seconds (normal range, 11.9 to 14.3); activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), 31.3 seconds (normal range, 29.1 to 43.5); serum iron, 65 µg/dL (normal range, 40 to 160); total iron binding capacity (TIBC), 258 µg/dL (normal range, 230 to 430); transferrin saturation, 25%; and ferritin, 158.6 ng/mL (normal range, 13 to 150). Serum chemistry values were also obtained: blood urea nitrogen, 26.9 mg/dL; creatinine, 1.98 mg/dL; glucose, 110 mg/dL; ALP, 1,011 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase, 23 U/L; and alanine aminotransferase, 11 U/L. Serum calcium was 14.6 mg/dL, phosphate was 3.5 mg/dL, and ionized calcium was 7.2 mg/dL. Serum protein and serum albumin were 6.9 and 3.7 g/dL, respectively. The results of the serum electrolyte test revealed that sodium was 135.7 mmol/L, potassium was 4.3 mmol/L, chloride was 104.0 mmol/L, and serum osmotic pressure was 286 mOsm/kg. According to the serum lipid examination, the total cholesterol was 146 mg/dL, triglyceride was 95 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein was 33 mg/dL, and low density lipoprotein was 79 mg/dL. A thyroid function test found T3 was 108.9 ng/dL (normal range, 80 to 200), thyroid stimulating hormone was 0.40 mIU/L (normal range, 0.27 to 4.2), and free T4 was 0.74 ng/dL (normal range, 0.93 to 1.70). Under dual energy X-ray absorptiometry-based bone density examination, the T-score of the lumbar region was -1.4, while the T-scores of the neck were -1.2 on the left and -1.8 on the right. Except for the fifth lumbar vertebra, which had spondylolisthesis, nothing remarkable was found on magnetic resonance imaging.\nAccording to further blood tests, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 was 9.6 ng/mL (normal range, 4.8 to 52.8), and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was 10.5 pg/mL (normal range, 19.6 to 54.3), while the intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) was 1,911 pg/mL (normal range, 15 to 65). When we performed bone scanning with 99mTc, the amount of cortical bone radioactive isotope uptake increased very high (). Because we suspected hyperparathyroidism, we carried out a 99mTc sestamibi scan and suspected the lesion that had been previously diagnosed as a left thyroid nodule was likely a parathyroid adenoma (). Using thyroid Doppler ultrasonography, we discovered a hypervascular adenoma that was 5-cm-sized solid mass with similar echo of surrounding thyroid tissue in the center, and slightly low echo in outer part in the inferior site of left thyroid gland (), while on the right thyroid parenchyma we discovered two thyroid nodules, 0.3 and 0.5 cm each in diameter, that the patient had had 4 years before. We performed neck computed tomography and found there was no neck lymph node metastastasis and local invasion of other organs ().\nThe patient received both hydration and diuretic treatments until she underwent a surgical operation to control the hypercalcemia; she also had pamidronate 90 mg intravenous injections twice a week. On the 11th day after hydration and diuretic treatment, her condition had improved; serum calcium was reduced to 11.6 mg/dL, and creatinine improved to 1.11 mg/dL. On the 12th day, the patient had left parathyroid excision and was diagnosed with a parathyroid adenoma (). Following the surgical procedure, iPTH normalized to 42.5 pg/mL, but calcium and vitamin D were prescribed for 9 months to cure the hypocalcemia that had developed due to hungry bone syndrome. It has been a year since the surgical operation, and her calcium, phosphate, ALP, and iPTH all remain at normal levels. What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

    "question": "A 33-year-old male with a significant medical history of hypertension and smoking presented to outpatient department with complaints of left-sided chest pain, SOB and episodic cough. The pain was moderate to severe in intensity, radiating to left arm and neck, continuous in nature, aggravated with movements with no relieving factors. It was not associated with fever, headache, vomiting or abdominal symptoms. The SOB was mostly experienced on walking and occasionally when lying flat. His family history was positive for cardiovascular disease as his father had fatal MI at a young age.\nPast medical records depicted that he was admitted to a local hospital in 2014 with a diagnosis of right-sided weakness secondary to cerebrovascular accielectrocardiogram dent. The magnetic resonance imaging scans of brain showed an acute infarction of area supplied by the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). Magnetic resonance angiography of the circle of Willis depicted occlusion of the left MCA at the horizontal M1 segment. The extracranial arteries did not show any abnormalities like plaque formation on evaluation by cervical echography. After initial management with intravenous (IV) aspirin, the patient was administered with IV clopidogrel. Long-term anticoagulation was not prescribed since no cause was identified. There were no complications and the patient’s hemiparesis gradually improved during the following months. Later in 2017, he developed SOB with acute retrosternal chest pain. His electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in leads V2-V4. Troponin T was raised up to 7,120 ng/L [normal (N)= 0-14]. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed moderate left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, concentric LV hypertrophy, regional wall motion abnormities and mild mitral regurgitation (Figure ). The patient was initially administered with xylocaine, heparin, nitroglycerine, atropine, metoprolol, clopidogrel and loop diuretics. Cardiac catheterization revealed total occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery for which the patient underwent primary angioplasty to LAD with a drug-eluting stent. After adequate management, the patient was discharged on aspirin, clopidogrel, bisoprolol, rosuvastatin, spironolactone, hydroxyzine and loop diuretics.\nOn examination, his blood pressure (BP) was 165/90 mmHg, respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute and heart rate was 70 beats per minute with no arrhythmia. General physical examination revealed palmar erythema, splinter hemorrhages and mild pedal edema. The SOB of New York Heart Association class III along with orthopnea was accompanied by productive cough and hemoptysis. Apex beat could not be palpated while lung fields were found to be clear on auscultation. Neurological examination showed no focal neurological deficits with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15/15. Other systemic examinations were insignificant.\nLaboratory evaluation on admission revealed hemoglobin of 14.5 g/dL (N=13.8-17.2), total leukocyte count of 7 x 109/L (N=4-11), platelet count of 249 x 109/L (N=150-400), prothrombin time of 10.7 seconds (N=11-13.5), activated partial thromboplastin time of 16.7 seconds (N=26-36) and international normalized ratio of 1.10 (N≤ 1.1). Serum electrolytes were normal, and creatinine was documented to be 0.8 mg/dL (N=0.6-1.2). Total bilirubin, albumin and globulin levels were within the normal range. Lipid profile was also normal with serum cholesterol of 114 mg/dL (N< 200), low-density lipoprotein of 55 mg/dL (N=60-130), high-density lipoprotein of 60 mg/dL (N=60), and triglyceride level of 75 mg/dL (N<150). However troponin I levels were raised up to 0.1 ng/mL (N≤ 0.04).\nThe initial ECG had 1-2 mm ST-segment elevation in leads I, V2-V5 and aVL with ST-segment depression in reciprocal leads (Figure ). Chest X-ray showed an enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with diffuse pulmonary edema (Figure ). The patient was initially managed with ascard, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, valsartan, bisoprolol, spironolactone,and omeprazole.\nTTE showed dilated LV with moderate dysfunction, akinetic LV apex, apical mid interventricular septum and inferior wall, and an ejection fraction (EF) of 35%. Carotid Doppler and duplex study of neck vessels (common carotid, external carotid, internal carotid and vertebral arteries) were found to be normal. Cardiac catheterization revealed a patent stent and thrombotic occlusion of the LAD. Considering the past history of stroke and MI in this young patient, blood samples were sent for a detailed coagulation profile. The serum homocysteine level was found to be 10 µmol/L (N=4-15), while factor V Leiden was also negative. Deficiency of PC and PS was finally diagnosed; values seen were 41.9% (N=70-123) and 53% (N=70-140), respectively.\nAlthough the patient recovered from SOB and pedal edema, the EF showed no improvement despite adequate antiplatelet therapy. The BP also dropped to 100/70 mmHg. The patient was discharged with anticoagulants, diuretics, beta-blockers and nitrates. The patient was advised for regular follow-ups, but unfortunately, he could not maintain follow-ups. What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

    "question": "A 59-year-old Hispanic male patient with a medical history of hypertension, obesity, and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (last HbA1c was 13%) presented to the emergency department for fever of 20 days duration and worsening cough with expectoration, as well as progressive respiratory distress. On admission, his vital signs were a blood pressure of 144/83 mmHg, heart rate of 74 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 50 breaths per minute, O2 saturation of 40% (room air), and temperature of 38 °C. On physical examination, he was found to be febrile, somnolent, and polypneic, with marked respiratory effort. Emergency orotracheal intubation and transfer to the intensive care unit were necessary.\nInitial screening showed thrombocytopenia (platelet count 138 × 103 cells/µl), leukocytosis (WBC 15,760 cells/ml, 90% neutrophils) with lymphopenia (6.20% lymphocytes), elevated transaminases (ALT 1507.4 IU and AST 3049.7 IU), elevated d-dimer (44,066 µg/ml), and negative RT-PCR SARS CoV-2 test. Chest X-ray showed extensive interstitial infiltrates in both lung fields (Fig. b). Considering the progressive decrease in total platelet count as well as gradual lymphopenia (Fig. ), a dengue IgM/IgG test was conducted and was positive, while the dengue PCR-RT test was negative. According to radiographic findings and respiratory involvement, the RT-PCR test for SARS CoV-2 was repeated on two more occasions, with negative results. Therefore, IgG antibodies for SARS CoV-2 were assayed and were positive.\nPositive serology for both SARS CoV-2 and dengue virus confirmed coinfection, so it was considered that he had probably entered a late stage of the disease. Steroid management was indicated according to COVID-19 management guidelines, in addition to pronation cycles, to which he presented poor response and persistent hypoxemia. During his stay in intensive care, he presented multiple complications, such as acute pulmonary embolism, with signs of secondary thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, bacterial superinfection in his lungs by Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Akin III acute renal failure. Computerized tomography angiography of the chest was performed, which confirmed acute pulmonary thromboembolism of multiple bilateral lobar and segmental bilateral branches with signs of secondary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary changes suggestive of organizing pneumonia secondary to viral infection (Fig. ). Details of the clinical description of the coinfection are presented in Table . The patient remained in the ICU for COVID-19, bacterial superinfection, and dengue with alarm signs for 63 days. His progression was slow, showing progressive clinical deterioration. He required prolonged mechanical ventilation and vasopressor management until he finally died.

Nine days prior to admission, her daughter returned from another European country and 3 days thereafter the daughter developed upper airways symptoms. The next day (day 0), the patient developed fatigue and unspecific body discomfort, with no airway symptoms. COVID-19 was confirmed in both the next days. Her medical condition improved temporarily until hospitalisation on day 7 due to several episodes of near-syncope and increased body and chest discomfort.\nBy admittance to hospital, the patient was isolated due to the COVID-19 infection. Blood pressure was 102/72 mm Hg, heart rate was 100 beats/min, respiratory rate was 17/min and rectal temperature was 37.2°C. Clinical examination revealed normal organ findings including pulmonary and cardiac examination. The ECG showed sinus tachycardia, insignificant ST-elevation in inferior leads and T-wave inversion in precordial leads (). Furthermore, there was low-voltage ECG with peak-to-peak QRS amplitude less than 5 mm in the standard leads and 10 mm in the precordial leads (V5 and V6). All ECG findings were stationary during the course. Laboratory findings showed glucose 7.2 mmol/L, normal electrolytes, mild elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP) 11 and significantly elevated leucocyte count 13.2×109/L, troponin T 108 ng/L, NT-proBNP 1025 ng/L. Comprehensive description of laboratory tests and therapy is shown in . Bedside cardiac ultrasound examination performed by the on-call cardiac resident using a hand-held ultrasound device revealed moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, reduced left ventricular EF, dilated inferior caval vein with reduced respiratory variation and pericardial effusion at a maximum of 18 mm, a small right ventricle and a slight impression of the right atrium (). She was subsequently transferred to the ICU and treated with fluid support and norepinephrine. Day to day fluid and pressor treatment are highlighted in . The results of the point-of-care ultrasound examination were confirmed by echocardiography at the ICU. The left ventricle presented with a moderate concentric hypertrophy with a small cavity with end-diastolic volume less than 70 mL. Furthermore, there was a striking hyperechogenic pattern of the endocardium and epicardium ( and ). She deteriorated the following day with decreasing blood pressure and diuresis, with only a modest response on supportive treatment with fluid and pressor (norepinephrine (NA) and dobutamine). Fluid support was provided due to extensive peripheral capillary leakage. The extremities were cold and wet, but cognition was normal and beside international normalization ratio (INR) 1.2–1.3 there was no other sign of organ failure. Pericardiocentesis was performed at day 9 due to subacute deterioration and echocardiographic signs of a tamponade including compression of the right atrium, dilated inferior vena cava without inspiratory diameter reduction and respiratory variation in volumes and flow velocities ( and ). After initial drainage of 300 mL of serosal pericardial fluid, there was an immediate reduction of the respiratory variation of inflow patterns. The systolic blood pressure increased from 60 mm Hg to 95 mm Hg followed by increased diuresis. Size and function of the cardiac chambers together with mitral inflow pattern and filling of the left ventricle normalised gradually over the following days (, ). The left ventricular myocardial thickness and striking echogenicity were reduced in the same period. Cardiac output and blood pressure improved correspondingly. The patient needed supportive fluid therapy due to capillary leakage until day 15 when she was transferred to the ward.\nThe pericardial fluid tested negative in PCR for COVID-19. Cardiac (CMRI) study performed at day 15 was consistent with the diagnosis of acute perimyocarditis. T1-mapping showed relaxation times of 1260–1270 ms in the anterolateral wall compared with 1090 ms in the septum. The corresponding T2-mapping relaxation times were 60–61 ms and 52–53 ms, respectively. Inversion recovery sequences showed a moderate epicardial late gadolinium enhancement in the anterolateral wall (). Myocardial biopsy was postponed due to the COVID-19 situation and rapid improvement. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 72-year-old man with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and prostate cancer accompanied by multiple bone metastasis had sudden chest and back pain and difficulty in breathing at rest. His chest pain was accompanied by heaviness, squeezing, and discomfort. His prostate cancer had been treated with bicalutamide (80 mg/day) for ∼2 years, and his cancer stage was stable. He was brought to our hospital by ambulance and his vital signs were as follows: heart rate 72/min, respiratory rate 24/min, an axillary temperature 36.2°C, saturation of percutaneous oxygen under room air 90%, and peak blood pressure of 190/108 mmHg. There was no pleural effusion or congestion in the chest radiograph (). Electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with a complete right bundle branch block (CRBBB) and no significant ST-segment changes (). His initial serum troponin I level was 0.05 ng/mL (normal value: <0.04 ng/mL) and the d-dimer level was 14.7 μg/mL (normal value: <1.0 μg/mL). White blood cell count was 12 900/μL (normal value: 4000–7500/μL) and brain natriuretic peptide was 110 pg/mL (normal value: <18.4 pg/mL); other laboratory values were within normal range. The echocardiogram did not show any wall motion abnormality, significant valve disease, right ventricle dilation, or obvious congenital heart disease such as a patent foramen ovale. His chest CT with contrast showed bilateral scattered PE and left deep vein thrombus (from popliteal vein to soleus vein) (). After admission, his chest pain persisted, and the serum troponin I level and ECG were checked repeatedly. Although his serial ECG did not show no significant changes (), his serum troponin I level 3 h after the admission was elevated to 0.90 ng/mL. Furthermore, reconstruction of the SDCT (IQon Spectral CT; Philips healthcare) images clearly showed a perfusion defect of the posterolateral left ventricle myocardium (), suggesting a combination of PE and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).\nFollowing these findings, coronary angiogram was then performed which showed total occlusion of the OM branch. Although atherosclerotic plaques were seen in multiple coronary arteries, significant stenosis was not observed except for the OM branch (). Consequently, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed to the occlusion site. After thrombectomy, intracoronary imaging using intravascular ultrasound was performed, and atherosclerotic plaque lesions were observed (). Two drug-eluting stents were deployed (Synergy 2.75/28 mm and Synergy 2.25/20 mm), and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 3 flow was achieved (). The creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB peaked at 2034 and 278 IU/L (normal values: CK 60–287 IU/L and CK-MB <25 IU/L) 8 h after the admission.\nFollowing treatment of ACS, we began treatment for PE with an oral anticoagulant (OAC, rivaroxaban 30 mg/day). He was relieved of his chest symptoms and was rescued from a hypoxic state. He was discharged on the 14th day after admission. Enhanced SDCT and associated reconstructed images of effective atomic number (Z-effective) 6 months after the treatment started, until when dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 100 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg/day) and OAC therapy (rivaroxaban 30 mg/day for 3 weeks and 15 mg/day after 3 weeks) were continued, showed improvement in perfusion defects in both pulmonary fields () and the myocardium (). His treatment was deescalated to single antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel 75 mg/day) and OAC, and he has had a good course without recurrence.

    "question": "A 60-year-old man was referred to our hospital for raised serum creatinine. The patient had abdominal pain for 15 days, which was mild, vague and non-radiating. It was followed by bilateral pedal edema in a day and in next three days followed by sudden onset bilateral foot drop with numbness. Patient gave history of nausea, vomiting, skin rash, anorexia and malaise since 20 days. He had weight loss of 10 kg in last 20 days. The past medical history was unremarkable. Alcohol consumption and drug abuse were absent. On physical examination, temperature was 38.4°C, blood pressure was 160/100 mm Hg, pulse rate 84/min and respiratory rate 20/min. Pedal edema was pitting, bilateral. Macular skin rashes around both ankles were present. Testicular tenderness was present. There was sensory and motor involvement in bilateral tibia and peroneal nerve distribution. Funduscopic examination showed grade 3 hypertensive retinopathy. Laboratory examination revealed a hemoglobin of 12.1 g/dl, white blood cell count of 24000/µl, platelet count of 485000/µl. Serum creatinine was 2.4 mg/dl, blood urea nitrogen 102 mg/dl, potassium 5.0 mEq/l, albumin 3.1 g/dl, aspartate aminotransferase 27 U/l, alanine aminotransferase 20 U/l, alkaline phosphatase 131 U/l and total cholesterol 198 mg/dl. Prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times were normal. Urinalysis revealed proteinuria, with two to three oval fat bodies per high-power field. Protein excretion was 3.4 g/day. Bence jones proteinuria, urine immunoelectrophoresis showed non selective proteinuria. On admission, HBsAg, HBeAg and anti-HBc IgM were positive. Anti-HBs, anti-HBe, anti-HCV and anti-HIV were negative. Serum HBV-DNA level (PCR) was 582917 copies/ml. ANA, anti-dsDNA, RF, p-ANCA, c-ANCA, and cryoglobulins were negative. Serum C3 and C4 complement levels were normal. Chest x-ray and electrocardiography were normal. The nerve conduction study was compatible with axonal and demyelinating polyneuropathy in bilateral lower limbs. A kidney biopsy was performed due to nephrotic range proteinuria and revealed membranous nephropathy (MN). All glomeruli were mildly enlarged. Capillary lumina were open and lined by thickened membranes and there was spikes on the external side of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) (Jones stain). Mild uniform matrix accentuation with normal cell distribution was noted. Tubules were moderately degenerated. Interstitial area was moderately prominent for edema with leucocyte infiltration. Immunofluorescence study, showed significant granular IgG deposition along the membranes of capillary in a diffuse pattern (). There was no immunofluorescent staining for fibrinogen, IgA, or IgM. Congo-red staining for amyloid was negative. A liver biopsy was not performed. Doppler study for renal vessels was normal and there were no microaneurysms characteristic of PAN. Prednisolone (60 mg/day), plasmapheresis (5courses) and entecavir (0.5 mg/ every second day) were started. At 2 months follow up, patient improved in the form of grade 3/5 power in both lower limbs with sensory improvement. Twenty-four hours proteinuria decreased to 800 mg/day and serum creatinine was 1.5 mg/dl with no pedal edema. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 6-year-old girl (height 110 cm, weight 20.3 kg) with no medical history had a fever 1 month before surgery. She visited a clinic and general hospital due to jaundice and malaise. At admission to the general hospital 2 weeks before surgery, she was diagnosed with acute hepatitis and was given liver protection drugs (Stronger Neo-Minophagen C, Lactulose, Vitamin K) and fresh frozen plasma, although her liver and coagulation function deteriorated during the course of treatment, along with decrease in platelet count. She was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of our children's medical center for blood purification therapy 4 days before surgery.\nOn examination, she looked ill. Physical examination revealed the following: blood pressure 95/56 mm Hg, pulse rate 72 beats/min, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min with SpO2 of 99% on room air, body temperature 37.3 °C, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of E3V4M6. Abdominal examination was unremarkable, with no hepatosplenomegaly. Examination of the eyes and skin revealed icterus.\nInitial laboratory investigations revealed thrombocytopenia (hemoglobin 13.0 g/dL, white cell count 3.4 × 103/μL, platelet count 9.1 × 104/μL). Electrolytes were normal (Na 139 mmol/L, K 4.2 mmol/L, Cl 103 mmol/L, Ca 9.5 mg/dL, Mg 2.3 mg/dL, P 3.9 mg/dL). Her coagulation profile was prolonged (prothrombin time 23%, prothrombin time-international normalized ratio 2.36, activated partial thromboplastin time 63.7 s) and liver function tests were abnormal (albumin 4.0 g/dL, total bilirubin 18.76 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 13.17 mg/dL, venous ammonia 70 μg/dL, lactate 2.2 mmol/L). Infectious disease screening tests were negative. Computed tomography (CT) scan of her abdomen showed lower absorption in the liver compared to the spleen, suggesting ALF. Cranial CT scan and fundus examination were normal. Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed slow spindle waves with a frequency of 1–2 Hz, without laterality or triphasic waves (Fig. a). Daily plasma exchange and continuous hemodiafiltration were started for ALF with HE. Mannitol was administered to prevent cerebral edema. A day before surgery, GCS scores worsened to E1VTM1. Clinically, she was unresponsive to pain and auditory stimuli, and her EEG showed high voltage continuous slow waves with a frequency of 0.5–1 Hz, without lateralization (Fig. b). Assuming deterioration of HE, emergency LT was considered vital. After obtaining informed consent from her family, urgent living donor LT with an extended left liver graft from her mother was planned on the 5th ICU day.\nGeneral anesthesia was induced with fentanyl (50 mcg) and rocuronium (20 mg) and maintained with remifentanil and rocuronium infusions (0.1–0.4 mcg/kg/min and 7 mcg/kg/min, respectively), along with sevoflurane inhalation at 0.5%. A BIS Quatro Brain Monitoring Sensor (Medtronic plc, Dublin, Ireland) was placed on the frontotemporal region, and her electroencephalogram, including BIS values, 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF95), and suppression ratio (SR), was continuously recorded at each phase of liver transplantation by the BIS monitor until the end of anesthesia (Fig. , Fig. a–d). The durations of anesthesia and surgery were 708 min and 637 min, respectively. The graft volume was 254 g, graft volume/recipient standard liver volume (GV/SLV) was 46.1%, and graft-to-recipient weight ratio (GRWR) was 1.27%. Warm and cold ischemia times were 40 min and 51 min, respectively. BIS values ranged from 10 to 20 from the start of the operation to reperfusion (Fig. ). From reperfusion to the end of the operation, BIS values ranged from 10 to 80, and the variation in BIS values also increased. The frequency of EEG waveforms and BIS values seen with BIS monitoring gradually increased (Fig. ). She was re-admitted to the PICU after surgery, extubated on postoperative day (POD) 2 and discharged from the PICU on POD 7. Follow-up EEG on POD 5 showed low amplitude and fast waves with a frequency of 9–10 Hz, without laterality or paroxysmal waves (Fig. c). However, she spoke only a few words until POD 7. Two weeks postoperatively, she was newly diagnosed with hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia. Her immunosuppressant regimen was changed and continued for post liver transplantation prophylaxis and aplastic anemia. She was discharged after 4 months of hospitalization. The cause of liver failure in the present case remains unknown. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 53-year-old Korean man who had undergone curative surgical resection for stage iii (T3N2M0) colon cancer was evaluated in clinic by his medical oncologist before the start of adjuvant chemotherapy. He appeared clinically well on assessment and proceeded to receive his first cycle of modified folfox-6 chemotherapy. This regimen consisted of oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, folinic acid 400 mg/m2, and 5-fluorouracil (5-fu) 400 mg/m2 bolus on day 1, followed by 5-fu 2400 mg/m2 by continuous infusion over the next 46 hours. Dexamethasone 12 mg and ondansetron 8 mg were given as pre-medication before chemotherapy.\nThe patient experienced no acute side effects or complications in the chemotherapy unit. He was discharged home with an ambulatory 5-fu pump and was scheduled to return to the clinic at completion of his 5-fu infusion.\nTwenty-four hours later, the patient presented to the emergency department with new symptoms of erratic behaviour and confusion. Collateral history from the accompanying family members revealed that he had suffered a brief generalized tonic–clonic seizure earlier in the day, but no apparent history of head injuries, infectious symptoms, or recent alcohol intake was present. The patient’s other medical problems included well-controlled hypertension, hyperlipidemia, polycystic kidney disease, chronic renal insufficiency (baseline creatinine: 172 mmol/L), and stable chronic hepatitis B carrier status without laboratory or radiologic evidence of cirrhosis. No history of epilepsy was present. The patient’s only oral medications were amlodipine, quinapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and atorvastatin. He was an ex-smoker, and he denied alcohol abuse and illicit drugs.\nOn examination in the emergency department, the patient was neither alert nor oriented. He was unable to follow commands, and his verbal responses were incomprehensible. He was agitated, and his limbs were tremulous at rest. Temperature was 35.9°C; heart rate, 82/min; respirations, 18/min; blood pressure, 130/84 mmHg; and O2 saturation on room air, 99%. The patient’s eyes appeared deviated to his left side, but pupils were equal and reactive. Spontaneous twitching of the extremities, on the left side more than on the right, was noted and attributed to possible complex partial seizures. No other focal neurologic deficits or evidence of trauma were present. The Brudzinski and Kernig signs were negative. Examinations of chest, heart, and abdomen were otherwise unremarkable. The patient was noted to be incontinent of urine during the assessment. He was treated with intravenous diazepam and phenytoin (given in a loading dose of 1000 mg) for his agitation and presumed seizure activity respectively. At this point, his 5-fu infusion pump was still attached and functioning.\nLaboratory investigations showed leucocytosis (white blood cell count: 19.5 × 109/L) with left shift, but an otherwise normal complete blood cell count. Liver enzyme tests were within normal limits. Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were elevated (239 mmol/L and 8.6 mmol/L respectively). Metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 29 mmol/L was present. Imaging of the head and brain by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scan respectively did not demonstrate evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, mass, or other abnormalities. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was benign, and subsequent cultures of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and urine were all negative. Of note, serum ammonia, at 316 mmol/L, and serum lactate, at 8.3 mmol/L, were elevated. The remainder of the toxicology screen was completely unremarkable. Vitamin B12 level and thyroid function tests were normal. An electroencephalogram showed a generalized slowing pattern consistent with metabolic encephalopathy.\nOver the next 8 hours, the patient’s mental status progressively deteriorated to a comatose state. The 5-fu infusion pump was discontinued. Because the patient was no longer adequately protecting his airway, the critical care team was consulted for patient intubation and admission to the intensive care unit. With an apparent cause for the rapidly progressive cognitive dysfunction still lacking, lactulose at a dose of 30 mL every 4 hours was administered by nasogastric tube shortly thereafter in an effort to correct the patient’s encephalopathy. Phenytoin was continued.\nFollowing the cessation of 5-fu and administration of lactulose, the patient gradually recovered over the next 48 hours from his acute confusional state. He experienced significant fatigue and muscle weakness, but no further seizures. Successive ammonia levels showed a decreasing trend. The patient was extubated, and phenytoin was discontinued. This man was discharged home on day 8 with instructions to follow up with his medical oncologist the following week.\nAfter discharge, the patient required several weeks to recuperate before he could embark on additional chemotherapy. Considering his presumed neuropsychiatric complication from folfox chemotherapy, raltitrexed (3 mg/m2) and oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2) were given every 3 weeks as adjuvant treatment instead. This therapy was provided on an inpatient basis because of the insistence of the patient. No significant adverse reactions were noted. Unfortunately, re-staging investigations shortly thereafter revealed three metastatic lesions in the liver. We plan to continue with further chemotherapy for this patient with the goal of potential resection of his liver lesions in the future. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 32-year-old female with a past medical history of obesity (body mass index of 42) and gastroesophageal reflux disease, not on home medications, presented to the emergency department complaining of worsening shortness of breath for two days. The patient was in her usual state of health until seven days before presentation, when she developed a dry cough, fever, chills, and malaise. She worked as a certified nursing assistant at a nursing home facility where a few cases of COVID-19 had been detected recently.\nIn the emergency department, her initial vital signs were as follows: temperature 99°F, pulse 106 beats per minute, blood pressure 107/70 mmHg, respiratory rate 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 70% on room air. Physical examination revealed an alert and oriented patient (Glasgow Coma Scale 15), with bilateral wheezing but otherwise unremarkable physical findings. She was promptly placed on nasal cannula and subsequently on nonrebreather 100% FiO2, with an improvement of her oxygen saturation to 95%.\nHer initial laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 10.9 K/µL (normal range [NR] 3.8-10.8 K/µL), absolute lymphocyte count of 0.64 K/µL (NR 0.85-3.9 K/µL), hemoglobin 14.1 g/dL (NR 13.2-17.1 g/dL), platelets 214 K/µL (NR 140-400 K/µL), C-reactive protein 30.94 mg/dL (NR < 0.80 mg/dL), ferritin 998 µg/L, lactic acid 3.3 mmol/L (NR 0.5-2.2 mmol/L), lactate dehydrogenase 556 U/L (NR 125-220 U/L), troponin was negative (NR < 0.30 ng/mL), creatinine 1.0 mg/dL (NR 0.7-1.3 mg/dL), Na 138 mmol/L (NR 135-145 mmol/L), K 3.4 mmol/L (NR 3.5-5.1 mmol/L), and high-sensitivity D-dimer 806 ng/mL (NR < 231 ng/mL).\nThe chest radiograph obtained in the emergency department demonstrated multiple rounded and peripheral ground-glass opacities throughout the lung fields (Figure ).\nA nasopharyngeal swab was performed and tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. Due to severe hypoxia, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). On hospital day 2, she underwent intubation and mechanical ventilation for worsening tachypnea and respiratory distress. The patient was started on intravenous steroids (methylprednisolone 40 mg every eight hours), received a dose of tocilizumab 400 mg, and completed a five-day course of hydroxychloroquine (800 mg/day for one day, then 400 mg/day for four days) and azithromycin (500 mg/day for one day, then 250 mg/day for four days).\nOn hospital day 3, her renal function worsened, and her creatinine peaked at 2.4 mg/dL, likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis. However, she remained with good urine output and no significant metabolic acidosis. Her creatinine gradually improved on the subsequent days, returning to the baseline renal function. The patient remained stable hemodynamically and sedated with hydromorphone and ketamine, but despite the optimized medical management she continued to spike fevers at 102°F, and repeated chest imaging with CT on day 5 showed significant worsening bilateral ground-glass airspace opacities (Figure ).\nOn hospital day 7, she received convalescent plasma transfusion and started on vancomycin after respiratory cultures demonstrated the presence of Staphylococcus aureus infection. On hospital day 8, the patient had an episode of oxygen desaturation to 75% with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 79, despite being on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 100% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 12 cm H2O. She was bagged by the respiratory therapist for over one hour and given the failure of mechanical ventilation to provide adequate oxygenation, the decision was to start VV-ECMO.\nThe patient’s left femoral vein was cannulated with a 28-Fr heparin-coated cannula for blood return and the left internal jugular vein was cannulated with a 21-Fr cannula for blood access. The patient was placed on VV-ECMO (CentriMag [Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA, USA] short-term external circulatory device) with initial settings of flow 4.5 liters per minute, speed 3,300 revolutions per minute, and ECMO FiO2 100%, sweep three liters per minute. She was started on heparin drip, received infusion of neuromuscular blocking agent cisatracurium for a short period, and then remained sedated with hydromorphone and lorazepam. She continued to have episodes of fevers up to 101°F, and repeated sputum cultures demonstrated the presence of Acinetobacter species and Proteus mirabilis, while blood cultures were negative. She was placed on cefepime for ventilator-associated pneumonia and the episodes of fevers gradually improved.\nOn the following two weeks, the patient was gradually able to wean down VV-ECMO settings, decreasing ECMO FiO2 to 40%, and flow to 3.6 liters per minute. On hospital day 20, she had a transvenous pacemaker placed due to several episodes of bradycardia with pauses lasting up to 19 seconds during oral care, likely vagally mediated. On hospital day 21, a bronchoscopy was performed and showed minimal secretions and no mucus plug. Given her prolonged time intubated, she underwent tracheostomy placement on hospital day 22. On hospital day 26, the patient was finally able to have VV-ECMO explanted, after 18 days of extracorporeal therapy. As she continued to improve clinically, the mechanical ventilation was successfully weaned off on hospital day 38. The patient was noted to have no neurological deficits, and was able to be downgraded from ICU to the medical ward on the following day. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 21-year-old female patient with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department with presyncope. Three weeks prior to her presentation, she tested positive for COVID-19 infection after developing symptoms of shortness of breath and chest pain. She was quarantined at her home and treated symptomatically with improvement. She never required hospitalization for her symptoms nor medications. She denied smoking and alcohol or illicit drug use along with any other medication that could cause QT interval prolongation. Upon her presentation, her physical examination was noted to be significant for bradycardia. Her vitals were blood pressure of 118/63 mmHg, a heart rate of 45 bpm, a temperature of 98.3 °F, and a respiratory rate of 18 sating 100% on room air. Her electrocardiogram showed 45 bpm with narrow QRS complex and premature atrial complexes.\nSignificant laboratory results included a WBC of 18.24 k/μL (3.60–9.50), troponin negative at <0.03 ng/mL (≤0.04), normal TSH at 3.79 uIU/mL (0.34–5.60), CRP at 27.00 mg/L (≤10.00), ESR at 51 mm/h (0–20), procalcitonin at <0.02 ng/mL (0.00–0.10), a COVID-19 PCR positive, BNP at 160 pg/mL (≤100), lactate at 1.2 mmol/L (0.5–2.2), and a negative urine drug screen. The chest X-ray showed no acute events. The transthoracic echocardiogram was normal with an EF of 60%. The patient was walked on treadmill and her junctional heart rhythm increased to 91 bpm; she was given 1 mg of atropine IV over a period of 5 min, in which her sinus rate increased to >100 bpm. Given the improvement in the patient’s symptoms, there was no indication for a dual chamber pacemaker. Hence, she was started on theophylline 200 mg oral dose daily with follow up within 1 week at the clinic (A,B). Upon her follow up, she had a heart rate of 90 bpm while on theophylline and no side effects were reported. Later, at her 5-week follow up visit, a complete resolution of her symptoms was reported and theophylline use was discontinued. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 22-month-old girl was admitted to our hospital with a three-day history of cough and rhinorrhea, a one-day history of fever, and an episode of generalized tonic clonic seizure with fever that lasted around 10 to 15 minute at 15 hours before admission.\nUpon arrival at the emergency center, her pulse rate was 140/min, blood pressure was 115/74 mmHg, respiratory rate was 28 breaths/min, and body temperature was 40.2℃. She had no spontaneous movement, no response to painful stimuli, no pupillary reflex, and no corneal reflex. Doll's eye movement was absent. Her pupils were 1 mm in diameter and nonreactive to light. Deep tendon reflexes were absent.\nApproximately 1 hour after arrival she had a second generalized tonic clonic seizure with fever that lasted 10 seconds, and was treated with 0.3 mg/kg of intravenous diazepam. She had dark brown-colored hematemesis, so we performed L-tube irrigation with normal saline. A computed tomography (CT) scan indicated diffuse symmetric low density in the basal ganglia, thalami, and pons with brain swelling (). Because of brain swelling, unstable vital sign, and thrombocytopenia, we decided to defer lumbar puncture and after all we did not make it. She was admitted to the intensive care unit.\nHer platelet count was 32,000/µL, white blood cell was 6,240/µL, aspartate aminotransferase was 4,579 U/L, alanine aminotransferase was 2,787 U/L, ammonia was 38 mmol/L and C-reactive protein was 1.0 mg/dL. Coagulation testing for prothrombin, partial thromboplastin and thrombin times, fibrin degradation products, and D-dimer were elevated. Blood urea nitrogen was 30 mg/dL and serum creatinine was 1.3 mg/dL. Creatine kinase-MB, myoglobin, and troponin-T were elevated. Respiratory virus polymerase chain reactions for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, and rhinovirus were negative, but the test for parainfluenza virus was positive on a nasal wash specimen. Serological tests for hepatitis viruses, mycoplasma, herpes virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and salmonella were all negative.\nElectroencephalography indicated extremely low voltage and featureless background rhythms (). Brain MRI performed on the day of hospitalization indicated diffuse bilateral symmetric signal changes of both basal ganglia, thalami, periventricular white matter, pons, and cerebral white matter, as well as generalized swelling of the brain. The involved areas were diffusely hypointense on T1W images () and hyperintense on T2W images (). We diagnosed the patient with ANE based on the clinical symptoms and MRI findings.\nThe patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated because of shallow breathing and profound alteration of sensorium on the day of hospitalization and she was treated with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, acyclovir, intravenous immunoglobulin, and methylprednisolone. A chest X-ray was normal at admission, but indicated right perihilar infiltration on the 5th day of admission. Her consciousness had no interval change, and blood pressure, heart rate, and urine output decreased on day 13. The 14th day of admission, she died due to multiple organ failure.

    "question": "A 65-year-old African American female with past medical history significant for noninsulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus, essential hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic back pain, morbid obesity (body mass index (BMI) was 41), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), uterine fibroids, generalized anxiety disorder, and former tobacco abuse presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of generalized abdominal pain of 3 weeks' duration with intermittent diarrhea and constipation. Upon review of systems, she complained of atypical chest pain which was pleuritic and reproducible on palpation. The chest pain was nonexertional but she had exertional dyspnea. Of note, she had no prior history of cardiovascular disease.\nPast surgical history was remarkable for cesarean section and hysterectomy. Prior to admission medications included metformin, hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol, ranitidine, and acetaminophen. Family history was remarkable for diabetes. In terms of social history, she was a former tobacco smoker, drank alcohol socially, and denied illicit drug use. She had a history of allergy to hydroxyzine, propoxyphene, and zomepirac.\nIn the ED, measurement of vital signs showed a temperature of 37.0°C, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 148/82, and pulse oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Initial physical examination was normal except for obesity, depressed mood, chest wall tenderness, mild abdominal distention with tympanic note to percussion and mild generalized nonspecific tenderness to palpation. Rectal exam showed small nonbleeding external hemorrhoids. Complete blood count and basic metabolic panel were normal except for blood glucose of 240 milligrams/deciliter (mg/dL). Hemoglobin A1c was 9.3%. Troponin I was slightly elevated at 0.07 and it trended down on second measurement. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with new T-wave inversion in the inferolateral leads. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was only remarkable for fecal stasis in the rectum. Her abdominal pain and constipation was partially relieved after administration of IV morphine and senna-docusate.\nShe was also given aspirin for the chest pain. After her abdominal symptoms moderately improved, she was placed in the observation unit for cardiology consultation. After evaluation by the cardiologist, she was admitted to a telemetry unit for an inpatient cardiac stress test. She was receiving 81 mg aspirin daily. On day 2 of hospital admission, she underwent myocardial perfusion scan using the standard 0.4 mg regadenoson (LEXISCAN) injection. The stress test showed reversible perfusion defect involving the apex and lateral wall of the left ventricle, suggesting myocardial ischemia. At that time, clopidogrel (Plavix) was added to aspirin and the patient was started on IV heparin per ACS protocol pending cardiac catheterization. On day 4, coronary angiography was performed and it showed no significant occlusive coronary artery disease (CAD). During the catheterization procedure, the patient received IV heparin and IV nitroglycerin in addition to midazolam for sedation and fentanyl for analgesia. The radio contrast used was iohexol (OMNIPAQUE 350). Post-procedure, IV heparin was discontinued while DAPT with aspirin and Plavix were resumed.\nAfter recovery from sedation, the patient complained of a headache which got progressively worse within a few hours. It did not improve with repeated doses of oral hydrocodone and oral/IV acetaminophen. After around 12 hours of cardiac catheterization, the patient developed acute left-sided ptosis, deviated gaze (down and outward palsy), and anisocoria with left pupillary dilation (mydriasis) consistent with acute left 3rd nerve palsy (). The patient did not complain of decreased vision and visual field testing by confrontation was normal. She had no other sensory or motor deficits. Her mental status examination did not show evidence of confusion. Her vital signs were normal. STAT CT head without contrast (per stroke protocol) was read as negative for acute intracranial process. CTA of the head and neck was negative for arterial stenosis or aneurysms. The next day, MRI head and orbit with and without contrast were done using Gadodiamide as the MRI contrast agent. The MRI report, as read in our hospital, indicated a nonenhancing heterogeneous pituitary mass measuring 1.9 × 2.0 cm in the greatest dimension and slightly compressing on the optic chiasm suggestive of pituitary macroadenoma (). There was no report of any bleed/infarction by either CT or MRI report.\nA multidisciplinary team approach was undertaken with involvement of neurology, endocrinology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology (ENT), and neurosurgery. A full ophthalmological examination was normal except for complete left 3rd nerve palsy and mild cataracts. Visual field testing was normal. Hormonal studies were ordered and the results were as shown in . Of note, prolactin was lower than normal, while adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level was above the reference range. Both follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) were considered low given the patient's postmenopausal status. The patient had normal random cortisol and free T4 level. She did not receive any IV glucocorticoids. The next day after the third nerve palsy, the patient developed a mild fever at 37.9°C with mild neutrophilic leukocytosis (white blood cell count 14.2 K/UL). The patient was transferred to a neuro step-down unit for close observation. Her vital signs remained mostly normal. Subjectively, she neither had a progression of symptoms nor developed new symptoms. Her headache was controlled with oral hydrocodone/acetaminophen. Her full neurologic examination remained normal except for isolated complete left oculomotor palsy. Leukocytosis gradually normalized over several days.\nPituitary apoplexy was highly suspected as a cause of the third nerve palsy, but the diagnosis was challenged by the fact that our radiologist's interpretation of imaging did not mention bleed or cavernous sinus extension. The diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy of the third nerve from microvascular ischemia was contemplated but it was felt less likely because it is usually pupil-sparing []. Neurosurgery requested ENT help for trans-sphenoidal pituitary resection. ENT did not feel comfortable with the plan and recommended transfer to a higher level center. The patient and her family were involved in decision making. They were truthfully told that our medical center is not a high volume center for such pituitary cases and the patient might benefit from a transfer to a more experienced center. They chose to transfer and the patient was transferred by ambulance to an academic center of excellence on day 7 of presentation.\nThere, neuroradiologists read the images obtained at our hospital differently. The new CT scan report indicated increased attenuation of the sella turcica and in the suprasellar cistern at the site of the patient's pituitary mass, suggestive of possible hemorrhage within the tumor (). The new MRI report indicated that there was a sellar/suprasellar mass lesion which appeared to show central intrinsic T1 shortening and hypoenhancement with peripheral right-sided enhancement. There was mass effect on the optic chiasm superiorly. The lesion appeared to extend laterally into the left cavernous sinus with mild mass effect on the cavernous internal carotid artery. The overall hypoenhancing portion measured 2.1 × 1.9 × 1.3 cm (Figures and ).\nThe physicians in the other hospital decided to proceed with surgical intervention hoping to relieve the pressure on the third nerve. On day 9 of symptoms, the patient underwent successful trans-sphenoidal pituitary resection. Intraoperatively, the neurosurgeon reported a typical contused apoplectic adenoma. A frozen section biopsy report, as well as final pathology report, confirmed necrotic pituitary tumor with evidence of recent hemorrhage. The apoplectic adenoma was removed and the pituitary gland was left intact. Postoperatively, the laboratory assessment indicated central hypothyroidism and secondary adrenal insufficiency. Vital signs were stable. No major sodium abnormalities were noted. The patient was started on oral hydrocortisone and levothyroxine. Otherwise, the immediate postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged home on day 11 of symptoms development. One-month follow-up at the neurosurgeon's office was remarkable for persistence of oculomotor palsy. A six-month follow-up is scheduled. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 46-year-old Japanese man without a remarkable medical history visited our hospital with chief complaints of fever, fatigue, generalized edema, and abdominal distention. His fever started two weeks prior to admission. Abdominal distention and edema gradually worsened, and he gained 7 kg of weight within two weeks, despite low food intake owing to loss of appetite. He denied previous episodes of infectious diseases. At initial presentation, he appeared exhausted. His vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 37.8 °C; blood pressure, 160/93 mmHg; heart rate, 109 beats/min; respiratory rate, 22 breathes/min; and oxygen saturation, 90% with room air. On physical examination, generalized pitting edema was observed. His heart sounds were normal, but his lung sounds were weak at the lung base on both sides. Jaundice was not observed, but a distended abdomen and hepatomegaly were observed. Blood test results on the day of admission revealed an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count (14,600/μL), mild anemia (hemoglobin level, 11.1 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 11.1 × 104/μL), renal impairment (blood urea nitrogen level, 60.7 mg/dL and serum creatinine level, 2.94 mg/dL), an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level (14.25 mg/dL), an elevated ALP level (768 U/L), polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia (immunoglobulin G [IgG], 2461 mg/dL), and an elevated IgG4 level (235 mg/dL). Immunological screening test results for autoantibodies were negative, except for positive antinuclear antibody (× 40) and anti-SS-A antibody. Polymerase chain reaction for HHV-8 DNA in a serum sample was negative (Table ). Computed tomography (CT) performed on the day of admission revealed massive pleural effusions and ascites, generalized mild lymphadenopathy (< 1.5 cm in diameter), and hepatosplenomegaly (Fig. ). Echocardiography performed on day 2 revealed normal wall motions without any sign of valvular disease, but a collapsed inferior vena cava was observed (maximum diameter < 5 mm). 18F–fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) revealed no apparent FDG uptake, except for slight uptake in the para-aortic lymph nodes (Fig. ). Considering the positive anti-SS-A antibody finding, lip biopsy was performed on day 6, but the pathological findings did not meet the criteria for Sjögren syndrome (SjS). On ophthalmological examination, keratoconjunctivitis was not observed; however, bilateral optic edema was remarkable (Fig. ). Serum IL-6 and plasma VEGF levels were assessed in a blood sample obtained on day 9, and both were elevated (25.2 pg/mL and 224 pg/mL, respectively). Abdominal paracentesis was performed on the same day, and the levels of IL-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in ascites were remarkably high (3310 pg/mL and 335 pg/mL, respectively). Bone marrow examination was performed on day 9. Bone marrow aspiration was dry tap, and bone marrow biopsy revealed a mild increase in megakaryocytes and mild reticulin myelofibrosis on silver impregnation staining (Fig. ). Biopsy of a cervical lymph node was performed on day 10, and the pathological findings were compatible with a mixed-type MCD histology (Fig. ). We suspected TAFRO syndrome and methylprednisolone (mPSL) pulse therapy (500 mg/day for three consecutive days) was initiated on day 10 after lymph node biopsy, followed by intravenous PSL (40 mg/day) and oral CsA administration. The disease severity of TAFRO syndrome one day prior to treatment initiation was very severe (grade 5) []. After the initiation of immunosuppressive treatment, the patient became afebrile and the CRP level returned to the normal range within two weeks. However, the patient’s platelet count and serum creatinine level as well as his overall condition did not improve, even after the initiation of immunosuppressive treatment (Fig. ). A central venous catheter was inserted and total parenteral nutrition was started as he could not eat owing to loss of appetite and refusal of tubal feeding. Diuretics, including furosemide, potassium canrenoate, trichlormethiazide, and tolvaptan were administered during hospitalization; however, the amount of ascites did not decrease (Fig. ). Urinalysis performed on day 25 revealed mild proteinuria (0.34 g/day) with a fractional excretion of sodium of 5.1% and a fractional excretion of urea nitrogen (FEUN) of 20.7%. Because urinalysis was performed under diuretics use, considering FEUN level and intravascular hypovolemia on echography, intravenous fluid replacement was performed to correct the pre-renal factor responsible for renal impairment. However, the patient’s volume depletion and blood pressure did not respond well to intravenous fluid replacement. Abdominal paracentesis was again performed on day 40, and it revealed persistently high levels of IL-6 and VEGF (4320 pg/mL and 421 pg/mL, respectively). Although urine volume was initially preserved with diuretic administration, the patient became oliguric from day 47 and anuric from day 49. He was hemodynamically unstable on day 50 (body temperature, 37.5 °C; blood pressure, 84/52 mmHg; heart rate, 109 beats/min; respiratory rate, 24 breaths/min; oxygen saturation, 95% with room air). As the patient was undergoing immunosuppressive therapy and his CRP levels increased by 10.08 mg/dL on the same day, systemic examination was performed to rule out the possibility of infectious disease. Analysis of ascites was performed on the same day, revealing purulent ascites, and Escherichia coli was isolated. E. coli was also isolated from blood cultures. CT of the chest showed a mass in the right lung (Fig. ) in addition to scattered appearance of high intensity regions in the myocardium, which were newly observed (Fig. ). Blood tests performed on day 50 revealed elevated β-d-glucan levels (23.0 pg/mL) and positive cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigenemia (41 cells/5 × 104 WBCs on the C7-HRP test). Aspergillus, Candida mannan, and Cryptococcus neoformans antigens were negative. We suspected bacterial peritonitis and fungal pneumonia. Intravenous meropenem, vancomycin, and caspofungin were initiated on the same day. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) using a polymethyl-methacrylate membrane was also initiated on the same day because anuria did not improve and the patient was hemodynamically unstable. Conditions of CRRT were as follows: mode, continuous hemodiafiltration; dialysis membrane, CH-1.8 W (Toray Medical Co., Ltd., Tokyo Japan); and anticoagulant, nafamostat mesilate. The blood, dialysate, substitute, and filtration flow rates were 100 mL/min, 400 mL/h, 400 mL/h, and 800 mL/h, respectively.\nHowever, approximately 10 h after CRRT initiation, cardiac arrest (ventricular fibrillation followed by pulseless electrical activity) suddenly occurred. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved by cardiopulmonary resuscitation with epinephrine injections. STEMI was suspected from electrocardiography findings obtained immediately after ROSC (Fig. ). Echocardiography performed immediately after ROSC revealed a generalized hypokinesis and akinesia of the anterior wall, septum, and apex without any apparent calcification of the cardiac wall. Blood tests performed after ROSC revealed a slightly elevated serum creatine kinase-MB level (80 U/L, normal range: < 25 U/L) and a remarkably elevated troponin I level (1.2904 ng/mL, normal range: < 0.0262 ng/mL), indicating the acute phase of MI. Emergent coronary angiography (CAG) was performed on the same day. On CAG, complete occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery was observed, and reperfusion was achieved through percutaneous old balloon angioplasty (Fig. ). An intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted to increase coronary blood flow and improve cardiogenic shock. However, even after successful coronary intervention, the patient was still hemodynamically unstable. Despite intensive care, the patient died on day 52.\nAutopsy was performed after obtaining consent from the patient’s relatives. The histological findings of autopsy are shown in Fig. . In this case, multiple infections, including bacterial peritonitis (small abscesses were observed in the abdominal space, and gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods were identified), systemic CMV infection (including the lungs, pancreas, and adrenal glands), and Trichosporon asahii infection in the lungs (T. asahii was isolated from sputum culture) were observed. Intravascular invasion of fungal hyphae was noted in the lungs. On histological evaluation of the heart, coagulation necrosis and neutrophil infiltration were observed, findings that were compatible with MI that occurred a few days before the autopsy. Considering that intravascular invasion of fungal hyphae was observed, embolization caused by fungal hyphae was a possible cause of MI in this case. Necrotic changes were observed in most internal organs. We considered multiple organ failure due to multiple severe infections and circulatory failure due to MI as the main causes of death in this patient. Although there was no stenotic lesion and vascular calcification was not apparent in the left anterior descending coronary artery, myocardial calcification was noted. Calcification in the skeletal muscle cells of the diaphragm and iliopsoas muscle without vascular calcification was also noted. The pathological findings of the kidney were compatible with thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and endothelial injury was noted, although fibrin thrombi were not observed in arterioles. IgA, IgG, and IgM were negative on immunofluorescence. Tubulointerstitial changes could not be evaluated because most of the tissue was necrotic due to changes after death and circulatory failure prior to death. In the bone marrow reevaluation, the number of megakaryocytes did not increase, and reticulin myelofibrosis was not remarkably changed. In the lymph node reevaluation, infiltration of plasma cells was decreased, and immunosuppressive therapy appeared partially effective, although the amount of ascites and IL-6 levels in ascites did not decrease in the present case. Fibrotic changes in the fat tissue of the anterior mediastinum were noted. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 27-year-old man presented to the emergency room with complaints of lightheadedness, dyspnoea, orthopnoea, and bilateral lower extremity oedema over the course of a few weeks. His symptoms were associated with chest discomfort and he denied similar past episodes. He had no significant past medical history. Family history was remarkable for a brother diagnosed with BTHS by genetic testing. The patient denied alcohol use and recreational drug use. He endorsed active cigarette smoking (0.33 packs per day). On presentation, the patient was afebrile with a temperature of 36.7°C, hypotensive to 86/54 mmHg, tachycardic to 104 beats per minute (b.p.m.), breathing at a rate of 18 breaths per minute, with an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. Physical examination was remarkable for diminished breath sounds at the lung bases bilaterally, tachycardia with regular rhythm, jugular venous distension to the earlobe, and 2+ pitting oedema in the lower extremities bilaterally. Complete blood count revealed leukopenia (2.9 k/μL; reference range: 4.0–10.8 k/μL), neutropenia (27.7%; reference range: 43.0–75.0%), and monocytosis (37.1%; reference range: 3.0–12.0%). Lipid panel showed total cholesterol of 91 mg/dL (reference range: 120–200 mg/dL), with a calculated LDL of 44 mg/dL (reference range: 0–99 mg/dL), and an HDL of 22 mg/dL (reference range: 40–59 mg/dL). Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with a ventricular rate of 128 b.p.m., criteria for left atrial enlargement, and a prolonged QTc interval of 589 ms (). The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation, diagnostic interventions, and treatment. Echocardiographic exam revealed enlargement of all four chambers ( and Video 1), with significant dilatation of the left ventricle (end-diastolic diameter 6.0 cm, end-systolic diameter 5.8 cm) and severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15–20%. Additionally, mild pulmonary hypertension was present. Ischaemic workup with coronary angiography revealed patent vessels ( and Video 2), and ventriculogram showed an LVEF of 20%. Right heart catheterization was remarkable for pulmonary arterial pressure of 26/11 mmHg (mean of 16 mmHg), a calculated Fick cardiac output of 3.18 L/min (normal range: 4–8 L/min) and a cardiac index of 2.02 L/min/m2 (normal range 2.5–4 L/min/m2). HIV testing was negative, ethanol level was within normal limits, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was mildly elevated at 5.12 μIU/mL (reference range: 0.4–4.0 μIU/mL), with free T4 within normal limits at 1.16 ng/dL. Based on the history of present illness, family history, physical examination findings, laboratory investigations, and diagnostic imaging results, the patient could likely have a diagnosis of BTHS. He was carefully diuresed to euvolemia, discharged in stable condition with a LifeVest wearable defibrillator for 3 months, and furosemide 20 mg per orum (PO) daily. He was also started on guideline-directed medical therapy including carvedilol 3.125 mg PO twice a day and sacubitril-valsartan 24–26 mg PO twice a day. At a 6-month follow-up visit, the patient had no further complaints, remained compliant with his discharge medications, and spironolactone 12.5 mg PO daily was added. An outpatient cardiac magnetic resonance imaging study with and without contrast for evaluation of infiltrative disease and other causes of non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy was non-suggestive of myocardial infarction, infiltrates, or other abnormal enhancement by late gadolinium enhancement imaging. The patient’s diagnosis was confirmed with outpatient genetic testing for TAZ gene mutation, and he continued to regularly follow-up with an advanced heart failure cardiologist. A repeat echocardiogram (Video 3) 2 years after the initial hospitalization showed evidence of cardiac remodelling with improvement in left ventricular size (end-diastolic diameter 5.02 cm, end-systolic diameter 4.06 cm) and LVEF (45–50%).

    "question": "An 88-year-old woman with a history of dementia, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, hypertension, and chronic cholelithiasis presented with nausea and non-bloody emesis for two days. No abdominal pain, fever, chills, dysuria, hematuria, melena, or hematochezia were exhibited.\nShe was hospitalized three years prior for a similar presentation. At that time, a CT scan was obtained which showed a large stone within the gallbladder (Figure ). During that presentation, the patient refused any surgical intervention and was treated conservatively. One year later, the patient returned with a similar presentation in which a second CT was obtained (Figure ) which showed a gall stone, as well as inflammatory changes and possible duodenal stricture. Thereafter, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and showed duodenopathy with a post-bulbar duodenal stricture. It was thought that the cholelithiasis may have caused inflammatory changes of the duodenum and led to the stricture formation. Pathological examination failed to demonstrate malignancy or Helicobacter pylori infection. She was treated conservatively per her request to avoid surgical intervention.\nExamination on this admission revealed a core temperature of 98.6, a heart rate of 78, a respiratory rate of 16, and an elevated blood pressure of 171/89. The patient had a normal mental status, respiratory, and cardiovascular examination. Abdominal examination was significant for moderate abdominal distention but otherwise unremarkable. Murphy’s sign was negative. There was no guarding or rigidity, no hernia was observed, and no masses or enlarged liver or spleen were palpated. Laboratory investigations were remarkable for an alkaline phosphatase of 283 unit/L (normal: 25 - 100), serum glucose of 171 mg/dl, and leukocytosis of 16.7 with a left shift. In addition, the renal panel was abnormal with a blood urea nitrogen of 33 and creatinine of 6.3. Other hepatic, hematologic, and metabolic studies were unremarkable.\nAn abdominal roentgenogram showed an abnormal gas pattern with distended gastric outline and gastrectasis which was increased compared to her prior studies obtained two years ago. A moderate stool burden was noted throughout the inferior colon and rectum representing fecal impaction. No free air or significant calcification were noted. An abdominal CT scan (Figure ) showed a large 4 cm gallstone in the duodenal bulb with interval development of air within the biliary tree and common duct. A nasogastric tube was placed and drained > 1 liter of dark, red-tinged fluid. Endoscopic studies revealed a normal esophagus, gastric antrum, and pylorus. Debris and fluid were found in the stomach and were suctioned using a gastroscope. A normal duodenal bulb with a large gallstone (4 - 5 cm) at the apex into the duodenal sweep was found. This was surrounded by mucosal edema. Because of the stone angulation, it was difficult to obtain purchase on the stone. Different devices were used in attempts to free the stone from the duodenum and manipulating it into the stomach. Efforts failed due to the calcified nature of the stone, the angulation of the duodenum, extensive inflammatory changes surrounding the stone, and the size of the stone. Subsequently, surgical management was discussed with the patient and her family who agreed to proceed with the operation.\nDiagnostic laparoscopy was attempted but failed due to the difficulty accessing the area of interest laparoscopically. Thus, an exploratory laparotomy was carried out. A midline incision was made and dissection was carried down until the duodenum was once again palpated. Attempts were made trying to move the stone proximally into the stomach; however, there was significant inflammation, as well as adhesions, in the duodenum from the longstanding cholecystitis and cholecystoduodenal fistula. Multiple attempts were made to try to lyse the adhesions, trying to free the angle into the stomach or make it less acute. Despite lysing all the adhesions and performing a limited Kocher maneuver, the attempts to move the stone into the stomach were unsuccessful. The surgical team then attempted to pass the stone more distally in an attempt to take it out through a jejunal enterotomy. The stoned moved freely down to D3/D4, but unfortunately, we were unable to move the stone beyond the ligament of Treitz. The ligament of Treitz was taken down, along with adhesions in the area; however, we were still unable to remove the stone. As there was some hematoma forming in this area, we elected to then proceed with a duodenotomy to retrieve the stone. The stone was moved back to D2, and electrocautery was used to make a 5 cm duodenotomy on the lateral antimesenteric border of the duodenum. The stone was encountered, freed, and extracted from the duodenum (Figure ). Repair of the duodenum and omental flap creation were performed. This was followed by placement of a gastrojejunostomy feeding tube. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 62-year-old female patient underwent a laparoscopic anterior resection procedure for sigmoid colon cancer. The patient who was discharged on postoperative day four uneventfully presented with complaints of abdominal pain, distended abdomen, nausea, and fever lasting for 24 hours on 4th day after discharge. Her past medical and surgical history was unremarkable except for a previous diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus for which she received prednisolone 16 mg/day as treatment.\nOn physical examination, she had fever at 38.7 C, blood pressure was 110/60 mm/Hg, heart rate was 100/min, and the respiratory rate was 18/min. She was in mild/acute distress and she was alert and oriented. Abdominal examination was notable for distention, hypoactive bowel sounds, and tenderness in all quadrants. There was guarding and rebound in the lower quadrants of the abdomen.\nLaboratory evaluation was remarkable for leukocytosis 18,000/mm3 (4500–10,000/mm3), and highly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels of 372 mg/dL (normal range < 5 mg/dL). All other laboratory parameters including electrolytes and renal and liver function tests were within the normal range. A computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed extravasation of luminal contrast from the anastomosis level into the pelvic region (). In addition, a collection of fluid measuring 8 × 5 cm was noticed in the pelvis. There was associated free air in the peritoneum.\nA diagnosis of peritonitis due to anastomosis leakage was made and urgent surgical intervention was recommended. The laparoscopic approach was planned. The abdomen was entered laparoscopically via the previous trocar sites. On laparoscopic exploration, the anastomosis site was characterized with small bowel adhesions covered with layers of fibrin clots and purulent fluid accumulation in the pelvic region. Aspiration of the purulent fluid was performed followed by separation of the small bowel adhesions. A 1 cm colon peritoneal fistula covered with fibrin layers was identified at the anastomosis site, which localized intraperitoneally. There was no fecal contamination. The abdomen was irrigated with isotonic saline solution and a complete decontamination of the pelvic contents was performed. After adequate drainage of pelvic collection, a drain was placed through the port site at the left lower quadrant across the anastomosis site into the pelvic region and the procedure was ended. The need for an ostomy was precluded as an endoscopic stent was planned for the closure of the anastomosis site. However, because our endoscopy unit had not been work at night time as emergency services, the patient was sent to the endoscopy unit on 5th hour after the operation.\nAt sigmoidoscopy, the anastomosis site with 1 cm fistula was identified at 17 cm above the anal verge (). To close the fistula, a 12 cm long partially coated SEMS (Hanarostent Duodenum/Pylorus Lasso, NCN, MI Tech Co., Seoul, South Korea) was placed across the site of leak successfully (). The patient was placed on prophylactic treatment with a third generation cephalosporin and intravenous metronidazole. A dramatic decrease in the patients fever and leukocytosis was observed 24 hours after the procedure. Abdominal pain gradually resolved and oral feeding was started. Abdominal drainage which started at a rate of 150–200 cc/day ceased after 5 days. Follow-up CT demonstrated complete resolution of the anastomosis leak and abscess. The drain was removed and stent removal was planned at four weeks after the procedures. On the seventh postoperative day, the patient was discharged uneventfully. Twenty-four days after the procedure, the patient presented again. She reported an incident of the stent falling out and passing in bowel motion. Sigmoidoscopy was performed and it was consistent with a complete healing of the anastomosis site, while the absence of the stent in the previously inserted location was confirmed (). During follow-up, the patients remained well with no complaints with defecation. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 74-year-old male with a history of mild cognitive impairment presented to the emergency department with failure to thrive and generalized weakness of three weeks duration. He was having difficulty swallowing which he related to a poorly fitted denture. He had thirty pounds of unintentional weight loss in the last three months due to loss of appetite. His past medical history was significant for diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, major depressive disorder, chronic pain syndrome, and hepatitis C. His social history was significant for 12.5 pack-year smoking and drinking (two to three glasses of wine/day). He denied any utilization of recreational drugs. In the emergency department, his vital signs were, BP-104/59 mmHg, HR-97 bpm, respiratory rate-14/minute, temperature-97.4 °F, and oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. He weighed 40 kg, and his BMI was 13.84 kg/m2. On physical examination, he was alert, oriented, and appeared weak and malnourished. The ill-fitted complete maxillary denture was removed. The oral cavity examination revealed a large (3 × 2 cm2) defect with an erythematous border that encompassed the mid-palatal structures and emanated from the hard palate into his nasal cavity (Figure ).\nThere was no discrete mass or ulcer and mucosa surrounding this defect appeared normal. On palpation, the lesion was non-tender without any palpable lymph node on the head and neck examination. His lungs, heart, neurological, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Laboratory data at admission showed Hb-11.7 g/dl, WBC’s-9.6 K/CMM, and platelets-190 K/CMM. The chemistry panel (BMP) was within the normal range. AST-23 U/L, ALT-25 U/L, and serum alkaline phosphatase were 114 U/L. Auto-immune work-up including anti-dsDNA, anti-proteinase-3 antibodies, myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibodies were negative. The patient was managed conservatively, with nutritional supplementation and supportive care. Contrast-enhanced CT of the neck demonstrates enlarged level 2A lymph nodes bilaterally (Figure and 2B), corresponding to increased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity on PET CT (Figure ).\nA biopsy of the palatal lesion was performed, which showed SCC (well-differentiated), with parakeratosis, acute, and chronic inflammation (Figure ).\nImmunohistochemistry by p16 shows diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic staining of well-differentiated SCC (Figure ). PD-L1 test showed a combined positive score of 10-15. CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis were negative for metastasis. NM bone scan showed radiotracer uptake in paranasal sinuses/facial bones. PET scan showed diffuse FDG activity in the hard palate, mildly hypermetabolic cervical, pretracheal, subcarinal, and left hilar nodes with minimal FDG activity. A diagnosis of locally advanced (stage IVa) oral cavity SCC was made. The patient was evaluated by a multidisciplinary team including an oncologist, head and neck surgeon, maxillofacial surgeon, radiation oncologist, and nutritionist for further management. The patient underwent prosthetic rehabilitation. A palatal obturator (prosthesis) was placed to improve his speech, eating, and prevent regurgitation. The patient opted for palliative care and did not want to pursue further treatment. He was discharged home. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 77-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with intractable nausea and bilious and non-bloody vomiting of one-day duration. This was associated with diffuse abdominal pain which he described as dull, non-radiating, and moderate in severity. His symptoms were exacerbated by oral intake. Prior to his presentation, he had normal bowel movements. He denied chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, dysphagia, diarrhea, or constipation. Past medical and surgical histories were noncontributory. The patient previously smoked 1.5 packs per day for 20 years but quit 31 years ago. He reported moderate alcohol use and denied illicit drug use.\nThree weeks prior to his presentation to the emergency department, he was diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic adenocarcinoma. He did not receive chemotherapy and elected for conservative management as well as palliative care. One day prior to his presentation, he underwent EUS-guided CPN for palliation of his debilitating pain. The procedure involved injecting bupivacaine and 98% absolute alcohol under general anesthesia to induce unilateral celiac plexus neurolysis. There were no immediate post-procedure complications, and the patient was discharged home in a stable condition soon after completion of the neurolysis. Of note, the patient was using oxycodone 5 mg oral tablets three times per day as needed for pain since his cancer diagnosis. In the last three weeks prior to the procedure, he did not complain of nausea or constipation. He also denied taking the medication more frequently than usual.\nIn the emergency department, vital signs demonstrated blood pressure of 115/73 mmHg, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37.2℃. Abdominal exam was significant for minimal epigastric tenderness without guarding or rebound tenderness. The remainder of the physical exam was noncontributory. Complete blood count (CBC) showed white blood cell (WBC) of 10.0 × 103/µL, hemoglobin of 12.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 295 × 103/µL. Basic metabolic panel (BMP) showed sodium of 135 mmol/L, potassium of 5.1 mmol/L, chloride of 96 mmol/L, creatinine of 1.34 mg/dL, glucose of 384 mg/dL, and anion gap of 9 mmol/L. Liver function tests showed aspartate transaminase (AST) of 12 U/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) of 17 U/L, alkaline phosphatase of 74 U/L, and total bilirubin of 0.4 mg/dL. Lipase was within reference range at 5.0 U/L. Urinalysis did not reveal ketones. Hemoglobin A1c was unremarkable at 5.4% and glucose levels normalized without treatment, suggesting that the initial hyperglycemia was probably related to stress.\nThe patient initially received intravenous fluids and was placed on a bowel rest regimen. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed significant gastric distension, which was concerning for obstruction at the level of the duodenum (Figure ).\nNext, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed large amounts of fluids within the gastric fundus and body, which was also concerning for duodenal obstruction. The examined first and second parts of the duodenum were normal (Figure ).\nAs a result, upper gastrointestinal series with barium swallow was performed to look for an obstruction distal to the second part of the duodenum. Although it showed delayed gastric emptying of the contrast, contrast was seen in the third part of the duodenum and jejunum ruling out a complete obstruction in the duodenum (Figure ).\nFinally, a push enteroscopy was performed to visualize the entire duodenum. It showed angulation in the third part of the duodenum but no obstruction or mucosal abnormalities in the third or fourth parts of the duodenum (Figure ).\nAt that point, extensive gastrointestinal workup ruled out small bowel obstruction, and the diagnosis of ileus was made. The patient received ondansetron and polyethylene glycol as needed, and his diet was advanced slowly. His symptoms improved over the course of a few days, and he experienced a return of normal bowel activity. He eventually tolerated a regular diet and was discharged home in a stable condition.

    "question": "In December 2019, a right-handed 38-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with increasing right shoulder pain and raised inflammatory parameters. Her past medical history was remarkable for paraplegia due to poliomyelitis in childhood and a residual epilepsy due to the sequelae of a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Apart from these conditions, for which she was wheelchair-bound, this patient was in good general health with a previous non-pathologic and well-functioning right shoulder.\nOne month prior to her admission with shoulder pain, she was involved in a car accident as a result of a tonic-clonic seizure. Upon admission, she developed hypertension with associated proteinuria and was diagnosed with a 26-week gestation previously unknown pregnancy and pre-eclampsia. She was previously nulliparous. At day six of hospitalization, the patient presented a spontaneous placental abruption and underwent an emergency caesarean section with a simple post-operative evolution.\nPhysical exam of her right upper extremity revealed a swollen, warm and painful right shoulder on palpation and mobilization without neurovascular disorder. On general examination, she had moderate asthenia without disorientation. The vital signs were: Temperature of 37.2 °C, heart rate at 104 beats per minute, blood pressure of 148/95 mmHg, respiratory rate at 23 per minute and an oxygen saturation within the norm (SpO2 95% breathing ambient air).\nHemoglobin was 101 G/L, leukocytes 9.8 G/L, thrombocytes 305 G/L and C-reactive protein was increased to 271 mg/L. Blood cultures were sent for culture.\nSuspecting right shoulder septic arthritis without any degenerative sign on X-ray (Fig. ), she underwent open surgical debridement, synovectomy and 9 L saline solution lavage of the right shoulder by a delto-pectoral approach with subscapularis tenotomy. Abundant pus at arthrotomy was observed with the observation of a stage 3 equivalent according to Gächter’s classification [].\nAwaiting culture results, empirical antibiotic treatment with intravenous 2,2 g 3td amoxicilline and clavulanic acid was initiated.\nWhilst the blood cultures and intra-operative cultures remained sterile (Fig. ) without any crystals positivity on microscopic analysis, the clinical evolution was unfavorable with persistent pain, inflammation and purulent drainage. The patient required two additional surgical debridements and lavages on days 4 and day 7 after the first surgery. Both surgical interventions revealed persistent amounts of purulent and fibrous material despite the previous procedures and the empirical antibiotic treatment.\nThe 16S ribosomal RNA PCR performed on the purulent intra-operative liquid revealed U. urealyticum at 2.95 × 106 copies/ml (Fig. ), positive specific cultures inoculated a posteriori confirmed this finding (Fig. ).\nCervical smear showed no simultaneous U. urealyticum genital infection. Fresh placental tissue was not available for further testing, but there was no evident macroscopic chorio-amnionitis.\nUpon receiving the microbiological documentation, a bi-therapy of levofloxacin and azithromycine was initiated. Susceptibility testing showed an intermediate sensibility to ciprofloxacin and clarithromycin. The strain was susceptible to doxycycline. Following cessation of breastfeeding, we started treatment with doxycycline for 4 weeks according to the guidelines of our institution and on the basis of the low initial therapeutic response []. Early mobilization was started with our physiotherapist (Fig. ). She showed a favorable course with an excellent biological and functional outcome with a post-surgical DASH score of 5,8 at 3 months follow-up []. As a reminder, a DASH score of 0 represents no disability and a score of 100 represents severe disability after surgery. Concerning the father of the infant, no other specific considerations were taken related to this infection. The infant presented good clinical evolution.

    "question": "A 40-year-old man was hospitalized due to jaundice and lethargic fatigue that started 10 days prior to admission. The patient had complaints of weight loss and night sweats. Four months prior to this admission, he had visited to the Department of ENT at another hospital with the complaint of nasal stuffiness. At that time, the serologic testing for hepatitis B antigen and anti-HIV antibody were positive. He has been treated with zidovudine, lamivudine and efavirenz for two months until admission. He assumed that his AIDS was transmitted from heterosexual contact at abroad ten years ago. On admission, the blood pressure was 120/70 mmHg, the pulse rate 90/min, the respiratory rate 20/min and the body temperature was 36.6℃. He was icteric on the physical examination. The liver was tender and firm in consistency. It was palpated at a three-finger breadth below the right costal margin. His spleen and lymph nodes were not enlarged. The laboratory results were normal apart from an ESR of 120 mm/h; leukopenia 3,930/mm3 (neutrophils: 58.8%, lymphocytes: 31% and monocytes: 8.4%) and hemoglobin 9.4 g/dL. The liver function tests were abnormal: total bilirubin 8.9 mg/dL (direct bilirubin: 6.05 mg/dL), AST 171 IU/L, ALT 100 IU/L and LDH 1063 IU/L. The total number of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes was 290/mm3 and 568/mm3, respectively, and the ratio of CD4/CD8 was 0.51. Abdominal enhanced CT scanning revealed multifocal and variable sized homogenous hypodense masses in both hepatic lobes (). A liver biopsy showed a heavy infiltration composed mainly of large lymphoid cells (). Immunohistochemical staining revealed the atypical cells to be CD20 positive (), which established a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma according to the WHO classification. Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated normal cellularity with normal maturation of all three cell lines. There was no malignant cell infiltration. After the patient was diagnosed as having diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, he received VAD (vincristine 0.4 mg, adriamycin 9 mg/m2, dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1-4, and additional dexamethasone on days 9-12 and days 17-20). The patient seemed to show a little clinical improvement, but before starting the second chemotherapy, he developed signs of spinal cord compression (). Emergency radiation therapy was delivered to the spine lesion. CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, adriamycin 50 mg/m2 and vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 on day 1 and prednisone 100 mg/m2 on days 1-5) and laminectomy induced temporary improvement (). Alas, the paraplegia continued and his clinical condition progressively worsened. He passed away 103 days after starting the second round of chemotherapy from complications of pressure sores, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism.
