    "question": "A 56-year-old man was admitted to the renal unit of the tertiary university hospital with symptoms of polyuria with nocturia, and polydipsia with severe thirst for the past 2 months. Initially, the patient visited a local clinic and was diagnosed as type 2 DM with a fasting blood sugar, 150mg/dL. Despite being controlled hyperglycemia with an oral hypoglycemic agent, he continued drinking daily more than 8 L of cold water (about 10 bottles of refrigerated water, 750 ml capacity) and passed large amounts of urine frequently. He had no specific history including head trauma or mental disorder, and denied any pertinent family history. The patient showed no signs of systemic illness such as fever or arthralgia, or neurologic symptoms involving the central nervous system. He has been working as a gardener with 176 cm in height and 68 kg in weight (71 kg before this event). The physical examination was unremarkable with blood pressure of 132/70 mmHg, pulse rate of 80/min, respiratory rate of 16/min, and temperature of 36.8℃. In the laboratory findings, his white blood cell count was 9,700/mm3; hemoglobin, 13.4 g/dL; platelet, 376×103/mm3; sodium, 140 mEq/L; potassium, 3.8 mEq/L; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 12 mg/dL; creatinine, 1.0 mg/dL and osmolality 295 mOsm/kg water. HbA1c was 7.2% and post-prandial glucose was checked around 180mg/dl with fasting blood sugar of 140 mg/dL. In urine analysis, the urine pH was 6.0; specific gravity 1.006; albumin (-); glucose (-); WBC 0-4/HPF; RBC 0-2/HPF, and osmolality 140mOsm/kg water. Fluid intake and output in 24 hours recorded 9 L in oral water intake from water containers and 11.7 L in urine output. In hormone assays, ACTH was 25.2 pg/mL (reference value, 6.0-76.0 pg/mL), prolactin 8 µg/L (reference value, 0-15 µg/L), cortisol 9.8 µg/dL (referencel value, 5-25 µg/dL), hGH 2.26 ng/mL (reference value, 0.5-17 ng/mL), and TSH 0.99 µU/mL (reference value, 0.5-4.7 µU/mL). Also, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity was within normal range (reference value, <40 U/L).\nOn hospital day 5, the patient underwent a water deprivation test according to the method of Miller-Moses test because of persistent polydipsia and polyuria despite blood glucose control. The results are shown in . During dehydration, the patient lost 3kg (4.4% of body weight), and urine osmolality remained hypotonic below 130 mOsm/kg. Basal ADH level was 5.18 pg/dL, and the repeat ADH level following the stimulation by water deprivation was 3.95 pg/dL, which revealed no increment despite the increased serum osmolality up to 300 mOsm/kg from the baseline levels of 285 to 295 mOsm/kg. One puff (5 µg) of desmopressin nasal spray resulted in the increase of urine osmolality to 266 mOsm/kg (>100% increase from the baseline level, 126 mOsm/kg) and in the marked reduction of urine output from 200-410 ml/hr to 44-60 ml/hr. These results were compatible with CDI,, whose causes would be mostly idiopathic because of normal findings in hypothalamus and hypophysis in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of sella ().\nOn discharge (hospital day 9), the dose of desmopressin nasal spray (minirin nasal spray®) was adjusted to 1 puff per 12 hrs (10 µg/day), and urine output was markedly reduced to below 2-3 L/day with no more intense thirst. Also, DM was controlled with fasting blood sugar below 115 mg/dL by metformin (novamet GR® 500mg bid) and American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended diet. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.",

    "question": "We are presenting a case with acute abdomen, i.e. ileoileal intusussception, caused by Burkitt lymphoma. A sixteen-year-old Caucasian Kosovar boy, presented in the surgical emergency clinic as acute abdomen, with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and problems with defecation and flatulence. The symptoms started three days ago, worsening on admission day.\nThe patient's height was 178 cm, and his weight was 70 kg. His vital signs were: blood pressure 120/80 mmHg; pulse rate: 76 beats/min; respiratory rate 20/min; body temperature 37.1°C.\nDuring physical examination, a distended, diffusely tender and painful abdomen with lower abdomen rebound was revealed. The patient's skin was pale with sweats.\nPlane abdominal radiography showed mechanical obstruction. (Fig. )\nThe emergency laboratory tests presented as follows: Red blood cells (RBC): 4.61 × 109/L; white blood cells (WBC): 7.3 × 109/L; Hemoglobin (Hgb): 128 g/L; Hematocrit (Htc): 0.42; blood sugar: 5.42 mmol/L; blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 2.6 mmol/L; serum creatinine: 88 μmol/L; BUN/Creat ratio: 8.5; total protein: 72 g/L; albumin: 36 g/l; ALP: 60 IU/L; ALT: 26 IU/L; AST:40 IU/L; direct bilirubin: 5.8 μmol/L; total bilirubin: 20.5 μmol/L; indirect bilirubin: 14.7 μmol/L; Gama GT: 26 IU/L; C-reactive protein: 15.6 mg/L; serum amylase: 30 U/L: electrolytes: Na: 138 mmol/L; K: 3.75 mmol/L; Cl: 102 mmol/L; urinalysis: 2-4 Leucocytes, some bacteria and some uric acid crystals. Blood group: O Rh(D) poz.\nThree weeks prior he had been surgically treated as acute abdomen caused by acute appendicitis and Mckelly Diverticulitis. Appendectomy and short resection of the ileum with diverticulum, and end-to-end anastomosis was performed. The immediate post operative period went well. After his discharge, his second hospital admission was two weeks after operation with abdominal pain and constipation problems which released spontaneously after two days.\nAt his third admission as acute abdomen, urgent laparotomy was performed in general endo tracheal anesthesia on the day after admission. Intra operative findings revealed small bowel dilatation, with intussusceptions of the terminal ileum, 2 cm from ileocecac valve. There were multiple enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes at the meso of the terminal ileum, ascending and the transverse colon, without palpable liver metastases.\nWe have done des intussusceptions caused by tumor from the wall of the ileum. (Fig. , , )\nAdhesions at the anastomosis, and 60 cm above that, were released. The right extended haemicolectomy with end to end ileum-transverse anastomosis was performed. Post operative period went well; blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg, pulse rate beats: 65/min; temp.: 36.7°C. The wound healed per primam. He was treated with frozen fresh plasma (several doses-seven), red blood cells (one dose); antibiotic, analgesics, H2 blockers, vitamins, amino acids, human albumins. He was discharged on the 10th postoperative days, with good bowel movements. He was oriented to the Hematology Department for further treatment, for Burkitt Lymphoma with chemotherapy.\nHP opinion: Giemsa staining demonstrated neoplastic lymphocytes infiltration. Immunochemical testing was positive for Burkitt lymphoma (CD10, CD20, CD34, Bcl-2, Ki67, IgM, MIB-1 with a proliferation index of over 90% of neoplastic cells) and c-myc translocation determined by FISH analysis (fusion and split).

    "question": "An 11-year-old girl was admitted to our hospital with microscopic hematuria and nephrotic-range proteinuria detected by school urinary screening. The patient did not have any characteristic features of Fabry’s disease such as angiokeratoma or neuralgia. On admission, her physical examination was unremarkable (body weight 47.4 kg, body height 157.3 cm), and her blood pressure normal (106/60 mmHg). Laboratory investigations revealed hypoproteinemia (serum total protein 5.6 g/dL, serum albumin 2.9 g/dL, serum IgG 318 mg/dL). All other biochemical investigations were within normal limits: blood urea nitrogen 8 mg/dL, serum creatinine 0.43 mg/dL, IgA 111 mg/dL, C3 140 mg/dL (normal 84 – 151 mg/dL), C4 26 mg/dL (normal 17 – 40 mg/dL). Anti-hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-hepatitis C antibody, and anti-nuclear antibody were negative. Urinalysis findings were 3+ for occult blood and 3+ for the dipstick protein reaction; her 24-hour urine protein excretion was 2.5 g. Light microscopy analysis of the initial renal biopsy specimen revealed diffuse mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis with fibrocellular crescents in 4 of 13 glomeruli (a). Immunofluorescence revealed granular deposits of IgA (3+) and C3 (1+) in the mesangial areas (b), and electron microscopy revealed paramesangial electron-dense deposits. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of severe IgA nephropathy was made. The patient was treated intravenously with three courses of methylprednisolone (20 mg/kg/day) pulse therapy (MPT), followed by 2 years of alternate-day prednisolone (initially 1 mg/kg and then tapered gradually) combined with an angiotensin receptor blocker (telmisartan 1 mg/kg/day). In addition, a tonsillectomy was performed 3 months after MPT. However, microscopic hematuria and mild proteinuria persisted.\nAt the age of 13 years, the patient was re-admitted for a second renal biopsy to assess the therapeutic effect. All laboratory investigations were within normal limits: serum total protein 6.3 g/dL, serum albumin 4.0 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen 12 mg/dL, serum creatinine 0.44 mg/dL, IgA 108 mg/dL, C3 96 mg/dL, C4 26 mg/dL. Urinalysis revealed a 2+ value for occult blood and a dipstick protein reaction of 2+; the 24-hour urine protein excretion was 0.5 g. Light microscopy analysis of the second renal biopsy specimen revealed focal segmental mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis. Immunofluorescence revealed granular deposits of IgA (2+) and C3 (1+) in the mesangial areas, and electron microscopy revealed paramesangial electron-dense deposits. After the second renal biopsy, the patient was additionally treated with three courses of MPT, and her microscopic hematuria disappeared within 6 months.\nAt the age of 15 years, she was admitted for a third renal biopsy. On admission, her physical examination was unremarkable (body weight 55.9 kg, body height 165 cm), and her blood pressure normal (102/70 mmHg). Laboratory investigations were all within normal limits: serum total protein 6.6 g/dL, serum albumin 4.2 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen 11 mg/dL, serum creatinine 0.48 mg/dL, IgA 135 mg/dL, C3 121 mg/dL, C4 25 mg/dL. Urinalysis was negative for occult blood and the dipstick protein reaction was 2+; her 24-hour urine protein excretion was 0.7 g. Light microscopy analysis of the third renal biopsy specimen revealed minor glomerular abnormalities (a). Immunofluorescence revealed granular deposits of IgA (2+) in the mesangial areas, and electron microscopy revealed paramesangial electron-dense deposits. In addition, numerous myelin-like bodies were first observed in podocytes (b). Low serum α-galactosidase A activity (13.8 Agal U, cut-off value < 20) and increased GL3 excretion in the urine (0.54 mg/mgCr, control 0.1 – 0.4) were also observed. On the basis of these findings, a final diagnosis of concomitant IgA nephropathy (healing stage) and subclinical Fabry’s disease was made.

    "question": "In 2008, a 59-year-old Japanese woman was admitted for evaluation of renal disease. RA had been diagnosed at another hospital in 1972 when she presented with bilateral arthropathy of the hands, knees, ankles, and feet. Treatment was started with a combination of a gold preparation and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but was not been effective. Prednisolone (PSL; 15 mg daily) and bucillamine (BUC; 200 mg daily) were started in 1987, but her disease remained active. Methotrexate (MTX; 5 mg daily) was started in 1995 but was discontinued because of nausea. In 2002, urinary protein was found to be positive by a dipstick urine test, and BUC was stopped. Then treatment was continued with PSL (5 mg/day) and loxoprofen (50 mg/day). However, urinary protein excretion increased in 2007, and serum creatinine (Cre) was elevated to 1.96 mg/dL.\nOn admission, the patient was 154.2 cm tall and weighed 44.0 kg, with a blood pressure of 128/60 mmHg and temperature of 36.4 °C. Physical examination did not reveal any abnormalities of the heart and lungs. The joints of her hands, knees, ankles, and feet showed bilateral swelling and deformity. In addition, the lower extremities were edematous. Her cervical spine was unstable, with flexion causing numbness in the upper limbs.\nLaboratory findings were as follows: serum Cre was 4.2 mg/dL, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 9.3 mL/min/1.73m3, C-reactive protein (CRP) was 0.9 mg/dL, and SAA was 43.2. In addition, rheumatoid factor (RF) was positive at 59 U/mL (normal: < 10), and cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies were positive at 218.5 (normal < 4.5). 24-hour urinary protein excretion was 6.5 g, and the urine sediment contained 1 – 5 red cells per high-power field (HPF). The disease activity score (DAS)-CRP was 7.1. Radiographs showed deformation of the finger and foot joints as well as atlantoaxial joint subluxation. Renal biopsy was performed for evaluation of her kidney disease.\nRenal biopsy\nLight microscopic examination of a biopsy specimen containing 4 glomeruli revealed global sclerosis in all 4. There was severe tubular atrophy, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis occupied ~ 95% of the entire renal cortex. All 4 glomeruli contained multinodular structures of amorphous material with a PAM-positive border. This material was positive for Congo-red and amyloid A, but was negative for κ and λ chains, β-2 microglobulin, and transthyretin (). Electron microscopy showed randomly arranged fibrils measuring 8 – 12 nm in diameter corresponding to the amyloid deposits (f). AA amyloidosis was diagnosed from these findings. In addition to the glomeruli, amyloid deposits were mainly observed in the interlobular artery walls and tubulointerstitium (e). Endoscopic biopsy of the stomach, duodenum, and colon revealed AA-positive deposits in the small arteries and tissues of the submucosal layer (a).\nClinical course\nPSL was discontinued, and administration of a soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor inhibitor (etanercept; 25 mg every 2 weeks) was started in May 2008, but it was not effective. By September 2008, Cre was increased to 6.0 mg/dL. She underwent surgery to prepare an arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis. Etanercept was discontinued, and a humanized anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody (tocilizumab; 8 mg/kg = 360 mg/month) was started in February 2009. After 3 months, her CRP decreased to 0.0 mg/dL, and the DAS28-CRP sore was 2.12. After 2 years of tocilizumab therapy, urinary protein excretion was decreased to 1.1 g/day, and Cre was 4.0 mg/dL. Subsequently, Cre remained in the range of 4.5 – 5.0 mg/dL until December 2017. While Cre increased to 7.1 mg/dL after initiation of treatment with denosumab (a human monoclonal antibody that binds to receptor activator of NFκB ligand) for osteoporosis in October 2018, it remained at 7.0 mg/dL in June 2019 ().\nGastroduodenal biopsy was performed in May 2013 and May 2017. On both occasions, no amyloid deposits were detected in the submucosal blood vessels (b). What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

    "question": "A 53-year old man (height, 175 cm; weight, 87 kg) was scheduled to undergo subtotal stomach-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy with portal vein reconstruction for pancreatic cancer after receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Laparoscopic left nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma was performed 1 year prior; therefore, harvesting the left internal jugular vein for portal vein reconstruction was planned because the left renal vein was too short. Preoperative serum creatinine level and potassium level were 1.39 mg/dL and 4.1 mEq/L, respectively.\nGeneral anesthesia was induced rapidly with propofol, rocuronium, fentanyl, and remifentanil and maintained with desflurane. The patient’s vital signs remained stable while resection of the distal stomach, gallbladder, distal common bile duct, and pancreatic head was performed. Bleeding from the first jejunal vein (J1V) occurred during adhesion detachment around the superior mesenteric vein (SMV), and clamping of the J1V was required to control the bleeding. Immediately after J1V clamping, bowel congestion progressed because the patient’s intestinal blood flow had been bypassed from the SMV to the inferior pancreaticoduodenal vein through J1V due to complete obstruction of the portal vein by the tumor. Therefore, a heparin-coated bypass tube (ANTHRON™ bypass tube, TORAY MEDICAL Co., Tokyo, Japan) was inserted from the SMV to the right great saphenous vein to relieve the bowel congestion. Several minutes after insertion of the ANTHRON™ bypass tube, blood potassium level rose from 4.7 mEq/L to 6.0 mEq/L, and pulseless ventricular tachycardia occurred. Chest compression was promptly performed by surgeons, and anesthesiologists attempted direct current defibrillation several times; epinephrine, magnesium sulphate, bicarbonate, lidocaine, and amiodarone were also administered. In addition to resuscitation, anesthesiologists inserted a blood-access catheter to the right internal jugular vein and started continuous renal replacement therapy to prevent elevation of blood potassium level. Spontaneous circulation was recovered after 30 min. The surgical team decided to discontinue the surgery, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) after packing gauze into the abdomen and with the ANTHRON™ bypass tube left inserted. Total blood loss was 5620 mL, and total fluid balance was + 6115 mL. The operation time was 10 h 30 min.\nTwo days after the first operation, the patient was scheduled to undergo tumor resection and portal vein reconstruction with REIV. The surgical team abandoned using the left internal jugular vein for portal vein reconstruction because of concerns that brain congestion after harvesting the jugular vein could affect brain function recovery. Anesthesia was maintained with dexmedetomidine, fentanyl, rocuronium, and remifentanil. Continuous hemodiafiltration had been performed in the ICU due to persistent anuria and continued during the operation to prevent hyperkalemia. Both legs were compressed with a pneumatic compression device throughout the operation to prevent deep venous thrombosis formation. A section of the REIV 5 cm in length was harvested intraperitoneally with a surgical stapler, and the REIV distal end was closed with a 4-0 polypropylene running suture. The inferior epigastric vein, pubic branch of the obturator vein, and the deep circumflex iliac vein were preserved. A surgical nurse noticed swelling of the patient’s right leg 2 h after harvesting; the surgical team ensured careful observation throughout the surgery because a transient change by congestion of the right leg was suspected. Blood potassium level was slightly elevated after REIV resection, but ventricular arrhythmia was absent. Surgery was completed as scheduled (operation time, 7 h 3 min), and the patient was transferred to the ICU again. Total blood loss and total fluid balance were 2485 mL and + 2587 mL, respectively.\nOn ICU admission, distention and fullness of the right leg worsened. An orthopedist diagnosed the patient with acute compartment syndrome, and right leg elevation to lower the intracompartmental pressure was initiated. Blood potassium level was rapidly elevated immediately after leg elevation (Fig. ), which caused sustained ventricular tachycardia despite efforts to lower blood potassium level such as the administration of bicarbonate, glucose-insulin, and continuous hemodialysis with potassium-free dialysate. Chest compressions were initiated immediately. Ventricular tachycardia was prolonged; therefore, veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO) was induced, and spontaneous circulation was recovered after resolution of hyperkalemia (Fig. , Table ). Emergent fasciotomy was performed by orthopedists 1 h after induction of V-A ECMO because the intracompartmental tissue pressure of the anterior compartment was 70 mmHg.\nV-A ECMO was withdrawn 2 days later, and the patient was extubated 10 days after portal vein reconstruction. He had no apparent neural deficits; however, paralysis and paresthesia of the right leg persisted after discharge from the ICU 17 days post-operatively.

    "question": "A 67-year-old Japanese woman underwent OWHTO to treat SPONK that had occurred in the left medial femoral condyle (Fig. ). The patient reported the following history of the present illness. Pain in the left knee joint initially occurred at 1 year and 4 months before admission, without any particular trigger. Her former treating physician had provided conservative treatments such as oral administration of anti-inflammatory analgesics, rehabilitation including quadriceps muscle training, and guidance on the use of a cane to relieve weight bearing. However, this treatment was not successful in relieving her symptoms, and she was referred to our department for surgery. The patient had a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and she had been taking oral candesartan and atorvastatin. The patient was a housewife with no noteworthy aspects related to social, family, or environmental history. On physical examination, the patient had a height of 157 cm, a body weight of 62 kg, and a body mass index of 25.2 kg/m2. She reported feeling pain in the medial joint space of the knee during walking, as well as during climbing or descending stairs. At the time of the first admission, her systolic/diastolic blood pressure was 165/97 mmHg. Table provides an overview of the patient’s pain scores in the knee joint, ROM of the knee joint, and knee joint function. Neurological examination revealed no abnormal findings. Similarly, laboratory findings at the time of the first admission did not indicate any abnormality: total protein 7.3 g/dl, albumin 4.6 g/dl, aspartate aminotransferase 22 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 18 U/L, lactate dehydrogenase 213 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 297 U/L, γ-glutamyl transferase 18 U/L, total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dl, Na 142 mEq/L, Cl 104 mEq/L, K 4.5 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 21.4 mg/dl, creatinine 0.56 mg/dl, Ca 9.7 mg/dl, inorganic phosphorus 3.7 mg/dl, leukocytes 5100/μl, erythrocytes 5.00 × 106/μl, hemoglobin 14.4 g/dl, hematocrit 43.6%, and platelets 263 × 103/μl.\nThe HAL-SJ treatment program was divided into five phases []. Phase 1 consisted of preoperative observation from the day of hospital admission until the day of surgery. The patient’s thigh circumference and lower leg length were measured preoperatively to adjust the HAL-SJ to the patient’s physical size, which would ensure appropriate training. We palpated the patient’s quadriceps muscles (vastus medialis, rectus femoris, and vastus lateralis) and attached electrodes to each muscle to detect the bioelectric potentials of the long axis along the belly of each muscle. We instructed the patient to perform knee extension and to contract her quadriceps. On the basis of these data, we instructed the patient to simulate the knee extension training, which would be performed postoperatively. Specifically, the patient sat with her lower leg hanging down naturally, and the height of the chair was adjusted so that the patient’s feet were not in contact with the floor. The patient performed ten knee extensions with HAL-SJ assistance, using the muscle that exhibited the largest bioelectric potential amplitude.\nPhase 2 involved surgery (day of surgery). The patient underwent OWHTO (Figs. and ) using TomoFix (DePuy Synthes, Bettlach, Switzerland), artificial bone (OSferion60, β-tricalcium phosphate; Olympus Terumo Biomaterials, Tokyo, Japan), and biplanar osteotomy, as described by Takeuchi et al. []. The preoperative weight-bearing line (WBL) percentage [], calculated on the basis of an anteroposterior weight-bearing radiograph of the affected leg in full knee extension, was 29.6%. The surgery was planned with a target postoperative WBL percentage of 62.5%. The actual enlarged angle and distance of osteotomy were 5.5 degrees and 7 mm, respectively.\nPhase 3 consisted of postoperative observation from day 1 to day 7 postoperatively. For postoperative rehabilitation, partial weight bearing was allowed after a non-weight-bearing period of 2 weeks, and full weight bearing began at 4 weeks postoperatively. The patient received rehabilitation training under the guidance of a physical therapist (ROM exercises and muscle-strengthening training) for 20–40 minutes each day, 5 days per week, from the first postoperative day until discharge. For ROM exercises, continuous passive motion training began on the first postoperative day for 1 hour per day and continued every day until discharge. On postoperative day 7, we attached electrodes to the quadriceps muscle to detect the bioelectric potential along the long axis of the rectus femoris muscle belly (Fig. ). Then, the patient was instructed to perform active knee extension exercises that involved contracting her quadriceps, thus simulating training with HAL-SJ (Fig. ).\nPhase 4 consisted of HAL-SJ therapy from postoperative day 8 to discharge. The CVC mode of HAL-SJ serves to support the patient’s voluntary motion on the basis of voluntary muscle activity and the assistive torque provided to the knee joint []. In this study, we used the CVC mode, which allowed the operator to adjust the degree of physical support to maintain the patient’s comfort while gradually reducing support as training progressed. In addition to the regular rehabilitation program (Fig. ), the patient performed HAL-JS-assisted knee extension exercises while sitting, which consisted of five sets of ten repetitions per set, twice per week (Fig. ). The training was performed six times before the patient was discharged (postoperative days 8, 10, 15, 17, 22, and 24). The mean training duration, including the time required to put on the HAL-SJ, was 15.5 ± 1.4 minutes (15 minutes, 16 minutes, 17 minutes, 16 minutes, 13 minutes, and 16 minutes during training sessions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively). There were no adverse events related to the use of HAL-SJ, and the patient was discharged 30 days after the surgery.\nPhase 5 consisted of post-HAL-SJ therapy observation from discharge until 3 months after the end of HAL-SJ therapy, during which the following indicators were assessed: EL, assessed as the difference between the maximum knee joint extension angle during passive exercise and that during active exercise; knee pain rated on the visual analogue scale (VAS); isometric knee extension muscle strength (IKEMS); active ROM before surgery, before and after HAL-SJ training, and at 1 and 3 months after the end of training; and the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score [] before surgery, at discharge, and at 1 and 3 months after the end of training. Furthermore, we used lateral radiographs to measure the tibial slope angle (TSA) and Insall-Salvati ratio (ISR) as indicators of patellar tendon shortening before surgery and after implant removal at 1 year after the operation [] (Fig. ). Measurement of knee ROM was performed using goniometry, and the landmarks used in the measurements were the greater trochanter of the femur, proximal head of the fibula, and lateral malleolus. Goniometry was used because it has been reported that goniometric measurements of ROM are more reliable than visual observation, with an accuracy of up to 1.0 degree []. The maximal IKEMS of the operated leg was assessed with the patient in a sitting position, with the hips and knees flexed at 90 degrees. A μTas F-1 handheld dynamometer (Anima Corp., Tokyo, Japan) was fixed to the chair, and two measurements were recorded. Each trial lasted 3–5 seconds, with 30 seconds of rest between trials. The higher score of two valid trials was recorded. All measurements were performed by a single trained physical therapist to eliminate interobserver variability. The EL, VAS, IKEMS, and ROM results are shown in Table . The EL improved from 3 degrees preoperatively to 0 degrees at the end of the sixth HAL-SJ training session, but it returned to 3 degrees at 1 and 3 months after the end of the training. When we compared results obtained before training against those obtained after each of the six training sessions, we observed that three sessions produced improved EL and three sessions produced improved or relatively constant VAS scores immediately after training. However, for the other three sessions, the patient reported increased pain immediately after training, with the greatest increase in pain reported immediately after the first HAL-SJ training session, when the VAS score was 1.7 times higher immediately after training than before training. The EL improved after training sessions 1 and 3, when the patient reported increased knee pain (expressed as the VAS score). However, the EL did not change after training sessions 2 and 4, when the patient reported less knee pain (improved VAS score immediately after training). The patient did not refuse to undergo training because of increased pain. The IKEMS value was the largest preoperatively (17.6 kgf) and decreased to its lowest value (30% of the preoperative strength) before the first HAL-SJ intervention at 8 days after the operation. The IKEMS remained relatively constant throughout HAL-SJ training but recovered to the preoperative value during follow-up (18.7 and 16.6 kgf at 1 and 3 months, respectively, after completion of HAL-SJ training). The active ROM also recovered to the preoperative value by the end of the sixth HAL-SJ training session. Thereafter, the extension ROM did not change, but the flexion ROM was maintained or improved. The JOA score decreased from 60 points preoperatively to 55 points at discharge, but it improved with time, reaching 65 and 85 points at 1 and 3 months, respectively, after the end of HAL-SJ training. Whereas the TSA was maintained at 13.1 degrees before and after the surgery, the ISR decreased from 1.13 preoperatively to 0.97 postoperatively. At 6 months after surgery, the passive ROM was 0–135 degrees, and the JOA score was 90 points. There were no complications throughout the preparation, surgery, or rehabilitation process.

Urine sodium was <10 mmol/L, urine creatinine 84 mg/dL, urine potassium 28 mmol/L and urine osmolality was 344 mOsm/kg. Fractional excretion of sodium was 0.4%. Urinalysis showed 1+ proteinuria, no microscopic hematuria, 5 white cells per high power field, no ketonuria, pH 5, specific gravity of 1.015, and negative nitrites and leukocytes. Plasma renin activity was 14 ng/mL/h (normal 0.5–4 ng/mL/h, upright) and serum aldosterone was 13 ng/dL (normal 4–31 ng/dL, upright). Blood and urine cultures were negative. Other extensive investigations for infectious etiologies were also negative. Urine for Chlamydia and Neisseria was negative. SARS-CoV-2 DNA PCR from the nasopharyngeal swab was negative. Other labs were notable for undetectable thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level < 0.030 mIU/L (reference 0.4–5 mIU/L), total T3 238 ng/dL (reference 87–178 ng/dL), and free T4 > 6.99 ng/dL (reference 0.6–1.2 ng/dL). Computed tomography of the head showed no acute intracranial abnormalities.\nInitial management included administration of intravenous fluids (IVF), propranolol, potassium iodide, propylthiouracil (PTU), and hydrocortisone. A presumptive diagnosis of hyperemesis gravidarum with thyroid storm and AKI secondary to persistent emesis was made. She met criteria for thyroid storm due to elevated serum free T4 and total T3 with undetected TSH, along with pyrexia, tachycardia, icterus, and altered mental status. Her clinical condition improved somewhat after receiving PTU, propranolol, and hydrocortisone as heart rate, blood pressure, and free T4 began to decrease. Her mental status improved and she became more alert and engaged in conversation. Given tachycardia and hypertension, she was started on propranolol 60 mg every 4 hours which was later converted to 160 mg daily.\nOther thyroid studies showed thyroid peroxidase antibody 0.3 IU/mL (reference < 9 IU/mL), TSH receptor antibody (TRAb) < 0.90 (reference < 1.75 IU/L), and undetected thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) of < 0.10 (reference ≤ 0.54 IU/L). Given negative TRAb, Graves’ disease was highly unlikely. Serum free T4 normalized in ten days, TSH in two weeks and total T3 in five days. Given pregnancy, further modalities including radioactive iodine uptake study were not pursued, given risk of fetal hypothyroidism, mental retardation, and increased risk of malignancy. Partial molar pregnancy was initially considered due to presentation of thyroid storm, however, the beta-hCG level was trending down and the patient did not show any signs of pre-eclampsia. Thyroid sonogram showed normal sized thyroid with homogenous thyroid texture and without increased vascularity, making Grave’s disease unlikely. Investigations for AKI included renal sonogram which showed right kidney measuring 12.8 cm in length and left kidney measuring 12.6 cm in length with bilateral normal cortical echogenicity without evidence of hydronephrosis or nephrocalcinosis. Hepatic sonogram showed gallbladder sludge. A chest X-ray was normal without pulmonary edema or cardiomegaly. Electrocardiogram showed normal Q-T interval. Echocardiogram was normal with ejection fraction of 65%. Cardiac enzymes were normal.\nPTU was later changed to methimazole as she was no longer in the first trimester of pregnancy and as she demonstrated signs of liver insufficiency. Anti-emetics and IVF were discontinued after few days as the patient was able to tolerate well by mouth. Hydrocortisone was discontinued after two days. Subsequently, propranolol was discontinued along with methimazole, as the beta-hCG mediated hyperemesis was thought to be the likely etiology of thyroid symptoms. Her vital signs, including BPs, remained stable and her thyroid levels returned to normal without anti-thyroid drugs. Serum beta-hCG at discharge was 175,557 mIU/mL. Given decreasing level of hCG without other signs or symptoms of gestational trophoblastic disease, molar pregnancy was unlikely. She was discharged without any thyroid medications.\nDuring the hospitalization, her serum potassium remained around 2.4–2.9 meq/L along with serum bicarbonate 30–38 meq/L despite resolution of emesis. Serum magnesium remained low, as well as with values ranging from 1–1.4 mg/dL. Twenty-four hour urine collection showed a urine calcium of 0.04 mg/kg/day. Random urine calcium to creatinine ratio was also low at 0.005. She required multiple intravenous potassium and magnesium supplements. Discharge serum potassium and magnesium was 3.5 meq/L and 1.2 mg/dL, respectively. She was discharged on magnesium oxide 400 mg daily and potassium chloride 10 meq twice daily. BUN and serum creatinine slowly improved with intravenous hydration. Kidney biopsy was not performed and renal replacement therapy was not required. Discharge BUN and serum creatinine was 15 mg/dL and 0.97 mg/dL (MDRD eGFR 90 mL/min/1.73 m2), respectively. Due to the persistent hypokalemia, alkalosis, hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria despite resolution of emesis, a genetic testing by next generation sequence analysis was done which showed that the patient was homozygous in the SLCA123 (NM_001126108.2) gene for a known sequence variant designated c.2581C>T (p.Arg861Cys) (Prevention Genetics, Marshfield, WI, USA). No further in vitro functional studies were performed, hence the exact functional implication of this variant was unknown. However, to determine the pathogenicity of this variant, in silico tests were performed using SIFT, PolyPhen-2, FATHMM and MutationTaster. The resulting prediction utilizing these in silico tools was “Pathogenic”. At 37 weeks gestation, a healthy infant of 3.5 kilograms was born vaginally without any perinatal complications. The serum creatinine remained stable at 0.7 mg/dL after delivery (MDRD eGFR 132 mL/min/1.73 m2). What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight.

    "question": "A 73-yr-old woman with atrial fibrillation presented to the emergency room complaining of chest discomfort, dyspnea, and agitation. The patient had suffered from atrial fibrillation for the last 2 yr. Her medications for the previous 2 yr included diltiazem 90 mg, metoprorol 25 mg, and aspirin 100 mg twice a day. In addition, she had been taking mirtazapine 30 mg, alprazolam 0.25 mg, and zolpidem 10 mg daily for a 6 yr history of dysthymia.\nPhysical examination showed a blood pressure of 100/83 mmHg, a heart rate of 100 beats/min, and a normal body temperature. Her body weight was 62.3 kg, and she was 158 cm in height. Initial laboratory results were unremarkable with a normal PT of 12.3 sec (INR 1.0). Routine chemical studies indicated normal values for total protein (6.6 g/dL), albumin (3.9 g/dL), aspartate aminotransferase (17 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (10 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (79 U/L), total bilirubin (0.3 mg/dL) blood urea nitrogen (16.4 mg/dL), creatinine (0.6 mg/dL), and electrolytes. Results of hematological studies including complete blood counts were also normal. Mild cardiomegaly was found on the chest radiography. Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation. Echocardiogram revealed mild aortic, mitral, and tricuspid regurgitation and left atrial enlargement (45 mm).\nThe patient underwent heparinization with an initial bolus administration of 3,600 IU heparin followed by continuous infusion for 6 days. Then the patient was started on 2 or 3 mg of warfarin daily (16.3 mg/week) to prevent thromboembolism, and was discharged after 3 days with a PT of 37.4 sec (INR 2.81). When she revisited the outpatient clinic after 3 days, her PT was found to be 50.0 sec (INR 3.68). After normalization of the patient's PT with warfarin withdrawal for 3 days, 1 or 2 mg/day (10.5 mg/week) of warfarin was prescribed. The PT after 3 days of treatment was 41.6 sec (INR 3.11). The administration of warfarin dose was changed (6.5-10.5 mg/week) continuously, which resulted in a PT of 20.9-43.1 sec (INR 1.64-3.21). She had to discontinue warfarin therapy temporarily 3 times. The difficulty in finding the optimal treatment dose during the induction period of anticoagulation continued for more than 2 month.\nThe patient continues to receive warfarin therapy at the outpatient clinic monthly and her PT remains within the recommended target therapeutic range (INR 2.0-3.0), even though her warfarin dose has been reduced to 6.5 mg/week.\nThe patient was genotyped for CYP2C9 after informed consent. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood, and all 9 exons of the CYP2C9 gene were amplified by PCR (-). The PCR products were sequenced using the ABI PRISIM BigDye terminator Cycle sequencing kit and an ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, U.S.A.). The patient was found to be an intermediate metabolizer with the genotype of CYP2C9*3/*4 (). What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

    "question": "A 31-year-old black Congolese female patient, P3G3, who had a pregnancy of 38 weeks and four days, was transferred from a district hospital to a tertiary facility in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, for severe preeclampsia with acute on chronic fetal distress. Her past medical history was notable for eclampsia during her first pregnancy in 2011 and preeclampsia in 2013 during her second pregnancy. She had had two cesarean sections for her pregnancies, and she had her antenatal care for her third pregnancy at a referral hospital. She was diagnosed with preeclampsia during her third pregnancy for which she received 250 mg alpha-methyl-dopa twice a day. ​​During the 30th week of gestation, the patient’s systolic blood pressure became labile, oscillating between 140 and 150 mmHg, despite her antihypertension medication. The patient consulted at a district hospital where she underwent a fetal wellbeing ultrasound which did not find anomalies.\nThe patient was the 7th of 9 children, and her father was hypertensive. She weighed 72 kg for 155 cm, and upon arrival at the authors’ hospital, her blood pressure was 217/152 mmHg. Her heart rate was 101 bpm, her respiratory rate was 24 cpm, and SpO2 was 96% free air. The patient was in pain, she was lucid and coherent, her palpebral conjunctivae were colored, and she had bilateral pitting edema. The fundus height was at 30 cm, the presentation was cephalic, the fetus was bradycardic at 88 bpm, and there were no signs of genital bleeding. The cervix was median, soft, 80% effaced with a 2 cm dilation. Urine deep stick revealed 3+ proteinuria. She had 1.5 mg/dL of creatinine (normal: 0.5–1.5 mg/dL), 22 mg/dL of urea (normal: 10–50 mg/dL), 15,000 white blood cells/ml, 213,000 platelets/ml and 14 g/dL hemoglobin. Based on these findings, we indicated an emergency cesarean section for acute fetal distress, which resulted in the extraction of a dead infant.\nPostoperative suites were marked on day two by decompensated anemia (hemoglobin at 7.8 mg/dL) for which the patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells. On postoperative day three, the patient presented an abdominal effusion, exacerbation of the bilateral pitting edema, blood pressure increase, hematemesis, melena, petechiae, hematuria, and oliguria. Her blood pressure was 215/120 mmHg and she had signs of renal failure (creatinine = 6.9 mg/dL (normal: 0.84–1.21 mg/dL); urea 132.5 mg/dL (normal: 5–20 mg/dL); hyperkalemia at 6.4 mmol/L (normal: 3.5–5 mmol/L); hyponatremia 109 mmol/L (normal: 136–145 mmol/L); hypocalcemia 0.88 mmol/L (normal: 1.12–1.32 mmol/L)), and signs of hepatic failure (AST 135 IU/L, normal: < 33 IU/L; ALT 325 IU/L, normal: < 33 IU/L; prothrombin ratio 100% (normal: 80–110%). PTT was 39 s (normal: 24–35 s), LDH was 1398 IU/L (normal: 120–280 IU/L), and total bilirubin was 0.35 mg/dL (normal: 0-1 mg/dL)). She equally had neutrophilic leukocytosis at 22,180 cells/mm3 and low platelets at 44,000 cells/mm3. Additionally, schistocytes were identified in the peripheral thin smear.\nThe team excluded TTP and HELLP syndrome as possible causes of the postpartum microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). This decision was based on the history, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome was retained as the final diagnosis, and in the absence of anti-complement therapy, the patient underwent four sessions of hemodialysis. Hypertension was treated with Nicardipine, 5 mg/hr. IV with a 2.5 mg/hr. increase every 15 min without exceeding 15 mg/hr., and the goal was to lower the systolic blood pressure below 160 mmHg. Hyperkalemia was corrected with insulin and glucose (10 units of insulin dose with 25 g of glucose per each 1 mmol/L of potassium above the normal). A favorable clinical and biologic evolution was observed, and the patient was released for outpatient follow-up on postoperative day 18 (Figs. , and ).\nLaboratory tests could not be obtained more frequently due to their financial burden to the patient and her immediate family. The patient had a normal kidney function at postoperative day 160 (urea 24.2 g/dL, creatinine 0.8 mg/dL) and postoperative day 202 (urea 16.9 g/dL, creatinine 0.8 mg/dL). She did not present new episodes of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

Two (2) years later, skin eruptions spread all over his body. At that time, he was diagnosed with psoriasis and prescribed topical clobetasol propionate. He had not been reexamined after that and has been using clobetasol propionate 0.005% routinely for 10 years. He has applied the drug to his arms, legs, and all over the trunk. Over the past year, he put on weight obviously (8 kg). He stopped the treatment 1 month ago, at the time of writing. He has been complaining of dry mouth and fatigue for the last month. On his physical examination, moon face, central adiposity, and purple-red striae on the abdomen under umbilicus were observed. There were scaly patches and erythematous plaques on the skull, interscapular area, sacrum, arms, legs, knees, and elbows []. Other systemic examinations were all normal.

    "question": "A 43-years-old Caucasian male (height 198 cm, weight 115 kg, tobacco smoker – 1 packet of cigarettes/day) was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital from a municipal hospital because of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome associated with infection and necrosis of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and fascia of the left lower leg. The signs and symptoms of the disease – edema and pain affecting the left leg-began 7 days before admission. The patient's medical history was significant for hepatitis C (HCV), treated with ribavarin and interferon, and diabetes mellitus treated with insulin. On the day of admission the HCV-RNA test was negative. A mosquito bite was the probable triggering event.\nOn admission to the ICU the patient was confused, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 9. He was afebrile, had tachycardia, with a heart rate of 120 beats per minute, hypotension, with a blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg, and relative respiratory insufficiency (oxygen saturation of 88% – 90%). He had moderately-dilated pupils with a delayed light reflex. We noted crepitus over the bilateral lung fields, a tender abdomen with absent bowel sounds, and oliguria. There were numerous hemorrhagic extravasations on the skin. Examination of the left leg revealed diffuse edema of the skin, with marked erythema and necrosis; margins of infection were sharply demarcated, spreading onto the buttock and perineum on the left side (Figure ). Laboratory tests showed a metabolic acidosis, with the following values: base excess -15 mmol/l, lactate level 7.3 mmol/l, PaO2 64 mmHg, platelet count 29,000/mm3, International Normalized Ratio (INR) 2.24, serum creatinine 691.6 μmol/l, bilirubin 62.6 μmol/l, and C-reactive Protein (CRP) 224.6 μg/dl.\nThe Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score on the day of admission was 31 points and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was 18 points. The patient required fluid resuscitation, endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation in BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure) mode, continuous intravenous infusion of catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine) and low doses of steroids to restore blood pressure. After obtaining cultures from the affected tissue, blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in appropriate media, empirical, broad-spectrum antibiotics were immediately administered (meropenem 3 g/day in a 3-h infusion, vancomycin 3 g/day in continuous infusion, metronidazole 1.5/day in 3 divided doses). Because of progressive organ dysfunction, therapy was started with activated protein C, in doses of 24 μg/kg/h; continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) was also started. After several hours, the patient developed atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 140 beats per minute and his blood pressure decreased to 80/50 mmHg. Electrical cardioversion was performed three times, followed by continuous infusion of cordarone (12 mg/kg/day). During this time, intensive fluid resuscitation was administered. During the first day, the patient received 12,800 ml of fluid (colloids and crystalloids). His unstable condition did not allow for early surgical management.\nThe cultures from the affected areas of skin contained Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus sciuri. Based on sensitivity results, vancomycin and metronidazole were discontinued, and penicillin G was started at a dose of 60 million units a day (intravenous) in 6 divided doses. Because the patient's poor condition persisted and the microbes were sensitive to clindamycin, it was added at 2.7 g/day in 3 divided doses. In spite of the lack of information about G-pathogens, meropenem was continued. The patient also received 40 g of commercially available gamma-globulin (intravenous), 8 units of packed red blood cells, 6 units of fresh frozen plasma, and 8 units of platelets. After several days his condition improved, with urine output of 100–150 ml/h and resolution of his metabolic acidosis. On the sixth day, the patient's hemodynamic parameters deteriorated again, with tachycardia to 160 beats per minute and a decrease in blood pressure to 85/60 mmHg. CVVH was administered again for detoxification. On the seventh day, the necrotic tissue was surgically excised (Figures , ). We also noted a progressive decline in the white blood cell count to 2,200/mm3, and administered granulocyte colony stimulating factor.\nCultures of the BAL showed 104 colony-forming units/ml of methycillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). (The patient had been a carrier of methycillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus [MSSA] isolated from his nose vestibule on admission.) Because MRSA also was present in blood cultures and the patient's condition remained poor, linezolid 1.2 g a day in 2 divided doses was initiated based on additional results of susceptibility tests. After 10 days of intensive treatment, the patient was hemodynamically stable, and we discontinued mechanical ventilation. 25 days after admission the patient was discharged to the trauma surgery ward for plastic reconstruction of his wounds.

    "question": "A 16-year-old female adolescent was referred to our hospital with severe hypertension (systolic pressure 178 mmHg), which was first detected 7 months prior to presentation during a routine annual physical examination. She complained of intermittent headache for about 1 year, and her previous blood pressure, measured 1 month prior to her detection of hypertension, had been normal. She showed mild hypokalemia (3.4 mmol/L) in a routine blood test, and an additional workup considering secondary hypertension was planned. Despite taking amlodipine (0.1 mg/kg twice a day), her blood pressure remained uncontrolled.\nUpon admission to our hospital, her systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 155 mmHg (>99th percentile) and 111 mmHg (>99th percentile) respectively. She was 162.8 cm tall (50th–75th percentile) and weighed 55 kg (50th–75th percentile). Physical examination including ophthalmological examination revealed no abnormality other than hypertension, and her family history was negative for hypertension or renal diseases. Laboratory examination revealed normal levels of hemoglobin (14.4 g/dL), serum creatinine (0.57 mg/dL), serum total cholesterol (144 mg/dL), and normal urinalysis. Serum sodium, potassium, chloride, and total carbon dioxide levels were 134 mmol/L, 3.4 mmol/L, 102 mmol/L, and 27 mmol/L, respectively. Plasma renin activity was 9.83 ng/mL/hr (normal, 0.5–3.3 ng/mL/hr), and serum aldosterone level was 77.3 ng/dL (normal, 4–48 ng/dL). Urinary levels of vanillylmandelic acid, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, metanephrine, and normetanephrine were normal, and plasma levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine were also normal. Chest radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography showed normal findings. Renal Doppler ultrasonography revealed an avascular bilobed cyst in the lower pole of the right kidney (). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) angiography showed bilaterally normal renal arteries and an eccentric soft tissue component at the peripheral aspect of the cystic lesion (). The mass remained unenhanced during the arterial phase, and its margin was indistinguishable from the surrounding tissue (). During the delayed phase, its eccentric capsule showed enhancement, and an intact mass could be observed (), consistent with CT findings of JGC tumors.\nA right partial nephrectomy was performed, and a clear resection margin was identified. The well-encapsulated mass measured 2.5 cm ×2.2 cm×2.0 cm in size with a partially cystic-appearing cut surface. Microscopic examination revealed sheets of polygonal tumor cells with amphophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical examination showed that the tumor cells stained positive for CD34 and focally positive for CD117 (C-Kit) and smooth muscle actin. ()\nPostoperatively, her blood pressure returned to normal (105/63 mmHg) without using any antihypertensive medication. On the 3rd postoperative day, the plasma renin activity (0.52 ng/mL/hr), serum aldosterone (3.9 ng/dL), and serum potassium (3.6 mmol/L) levels returned to normal. Her blood pressure and laboratory findings remained within the reference range over the next 3 years postoperatively until her last follow-up.

    "question": "A 23-year-old man presented to hospital with a 2-week history of oedema, frothy urine and lower abdominal pain. This is on a background of ulcerative colitis (UC) for which he was on sulfasalazine. He denied any other regular medications, over the counter medications or herbal supplements. His family history included his mother having IgA nephropathy. He was an occasional smoker and rarely consumed alcohol. He denied illicit drug use. On examination, he was mildly tachycardic (105 beats per minute) and normotensive. He was 180 cm tall and weighed 93 kg. He had mild bilateral pitting oedema to his knees. The rest of his examination was unremarkable. Investigations revealed normal renal function with a creatinine of 75 μmol/L, hypoalbuminaemia with a serum albumin of 15 g/l and urinalysis revealing 3+ protein. His urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (uACR) was 944.9 mg/mmol. His total cholesterol was 8.3 mmol/L. GN, vasculitis, infection and myeloma screen (dsDNA, C3 & C4, anti-PLA-2R, hepatitis B & C serology, serum free light chains and serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation) were negative, with the exception of a positive atypical perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA). Importantly the myeloperoxidase (MPO) and proteinase 3 (PR3) titres were both < 1 IU/ml. ANCA positivity is most likely explained by our patient’s history of UC where ANCA positivity is reported in 60–80% of patients, with a predominant p-ANCA pattern [].\nDuring preparation for renal biopsy our patient was found to have a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 47 s. This corrected on a mixing study. Factor 12 deficiency (29%) was subsequently identified. Haematology opinion was that this conferred no increase in in vivo bleeding risk.\nRenal biopsy was undertaken with LM revealing no morphological abnormality (see Fig. ). IF revealed nonspecific trace glomerular deposits of IgM and C3. MCD was the most likely diagnosis. Our patient was consequently commenced on 75 mg oral prednisone daily.\nAfter 1 month our patient achieved complete remission. He was no longer oedematous, his serum albumin was 33 g/l (from 15 g/L) and uACR was 0.7 mg/mmol (from 944.9 mg/mmol). His prednisone was slowly weaned from 75 mg daily to 50 mg daily for a fortnight and then 25 mg daily for a fortnight. Our patient remained in remission with a serum albumin of 39 g/L, total cholesterol of 6 mmol/L and no albuminuria.\nThe electron microscopy (EM) report from our patient’s renal biopsy returned 2 months later. This revealed patchy foot process effacement, and mesangial expansion with some deposits suggestive of a mesangiopathic process (see Fig. ).\nOur patient then suffered a dramatic relapse with the prednisone dose at 20 mg/day. He reported recurrence of frothy urine, 4 kg of weight gain and proteinuria (on urine dipstick given for home monitoring). His prednisone was increased to 25 mg daily but despite this his oedema worsened and proteinuria persisted. Therefore his prednisone dose was further increased to 75 mg daily to induce remission (see Fig. ).\nA complete clinical remission was achieved over the next 2 months with serum albumin improving to 38 g/L and total cholesterol to 6.3 mmol/L. At this stage he was commenced on oral cyclosporin 100 mg BD as a steroid sparing agent given the previous failed attempt to wean steroids. Over the next 5 months our patient’s prednisone dosage was weaned more slowly. At a dose of 10 mg prednisone daily he suffered a second relapse with recurrence of oedema in association with albuminuria and hypoalbuminaemia to his previous levels. His prednisone dose was increased back to 50 mg daily and then 75 mg daily to re-induce remission.\nGiven his multiple relapses, steroid dependence and initial EM report suggestive of a mesangiopathic process, our patient underwent a second renal biopsy. LM was again normal, however IF found significant mesangial deposits of IgM (2–3+) and C3 (2–3+) (see Figs. and ). IgM nephropathy was then consider a possible diagnosis.\nThis time our patient took longer to achieve remission, requiring 75 mg prednisone daily and an increase in his cyclosporin dose to 125 mg BD. His prednisone dose was again weaned to 25 mg daily. He also self-ceased his cyclosporin. Our patient was adherent to the recommended prednisone dose as he recognised that without it he would relapse, and he felt further relapses would impact his career progression.\nAfter more than 12 months on prednisone 25 mg daily, and a total of 2 years on continuous corticosteroids, our patient agreed to a slow wean of the corticosteroid dose. Our plan was to use anti-human CD20 (Rituximab) if severe nephrosis recurred. He once again relapsed as soon as his prednisone dose reached 20 mg daily. At this stage his prednisone was increased to 50 mg daily, and he received the first of two planned doses of Rituximab 1 g as an outpatient. He suffered no adverse reactions from the rituximab. During this relapse, his serum albumin reached 10 g/L, 24 h urinary protein was 14.76 g/day and his total cholesterol was 11.5 mmol/L (see Fig. ).\nSeveral days after the rituximab infusion, our patient presented to the Emergency Department with a severe headache, nausea and vomiting. His headache had been progressively worsening since the day prior to his rituximab infusion. There were no focal neurological signs on examination. Computed tomography brain (CTB) and computed tomography angiogram (CTA) revealed a right transverse sinus thrombosis and non-occlusive posterior sagittal sinus thrombosis. We found no evidence of any inherited or acquired thrombophilia with extensive testing (anti-thrombin 3, factor V Leiden, lupus anticoagulant, prothrombin gene mutation, protein C & S, JAK 2 mutation analysis and paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria assay). He was commenced on therapeutic enoxaparin and bridged to warfarin.\nHe went on to receive a second dose of rituximab 1-month later. Since then he has remained in complete remission (see Fig. ). His prednisone was weaned over the following 6 months, and his prednisone was ceased. A repeat CTB and CTA showed resolution of the transverse sinus and posterior sagittal sinus thromboses and a decision was made to stop anti-coagulation.

    "question": "A 27-year-old female presented to the Gout Clinic of Peking Union Medical College Hospital with recurrent arthritis and infertility. Fourteen years before presentation, she noticed protrusion of her right ankle but did not undergo evaluation at a hospital. Eight years before presentation, at age 19, she experienced acute pain and swelling of her right ankle. The pain resolved spontaneously but recurred 6 to 7 times/year, involving the bilateral metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints, bilateral ankles, and right knee. Her serum urate level (SUA) was elevated to 789 μmol/L. A diagnosis of gout was made, and she was prescribed NSAIDs for pain relief and allopurinol and benzbromarone to lower her urate level. However, she discontinued allopurinol and benzbromarone on her own as these medications triggered acute flares. Five years before presentation, she noticed multiple nodules in her MTP joints, ankles, and fingers. The nodules on her feet interfered with normal walking. She also complained of the inability to conceive after 3 years of attempts. Her age at menarche was 14 years, and her cycles were irregular. She was reported to prefer snacks and fatty food during her childhood. Her father had hypertension. Her grandfather had an SUA level greater than 400 μmol/L but without gout. On physical examination, the patient was generally healthy, with a height of 168 cm and a weight of 55 kg. Her blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg. Cardiac and pulmonary examinations were normal. On abdominal palpation, the liver was enlarged with a normal soft texture. A joint examination revealed multiple nodules on the bilateral MTP1 joints, ankles, and fingers.\nA serological examination after overnight fasting revealed a SUA level of 548 μmol/L, serum creatinine (Cr) level of 49 μmol/L, fasting glucose level of 3.6 mmol/L, total triglyceride level of 6.22 mmol/L, and total cholesterol level of 6.60 mmol/L. Her resting lactate level was 7.4 mmol/L. Her 24-h urine urate level was 2.262 mmol/24 h, and her fractional excretion of uric acid (FE-UA) was 2.48 %. Her liver enzymes were normal. The estrogen level and basal body temperature curve were normal for her age and menstrual status. Renal ultrasonography revealed normal kidney size with possible calcium deposits in the bilateral renal medulla. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of her abdomen showed hepatomegaly without nodules. The pelvic ultrasonography and salpingography findings were normal. Serum examinations of her parents and her husband were normal.\nWhole blood DNA was extracted from all four family members (the patient, both parents, and her husband) after signing an informed consent form. A genetic study was first conducted with a target gene sequencing approach. A search of the OMIM, NIH, and PubMed databases using the key words “FEMALE,” “GOUT,” and “HYPERLACTACIDEMIA” indicated familial juvenile hyperuricaemic nephropathy, glycogen storage disease type I, and glycogen storage disease type II. Next-generation sequencing was used to sequence each of the exons of the UMOD, RENIN, G6PC, SLC37A4, and GAA genes, as well as two SNP loci (rs2231142 and rs72552713) of ABCG2 found in our previous report of a family including a female with gout.\nThe genetic sequencing results showed that UMOD, RENIN, SLC37A4, GAA and rs72552713 of ABCG2 were all normal in the patient and her family. Sequencing of the G6PC gene revealed composite heterozygous c.190G>T/c.508C>T mutations in the patient, a heterozygous c.190G>T mutation in her father, and a heterozygous c.508C>T mutation in her mother. The genetic analysis of her husband was normal. The c.190G>T mutation was located on exon 1 and encoded a missense mutation of p.V64L, whereas the c.508C>T mutation was located on exon 4 and encoded a nonsense mutation of p.R170X (Fig. ). Sequencing of 50 healthy females and 100 healthy males at the two loci produced normal results. To our knowledge, the c.190G>T mutation has not been reported in previous literature.

    "question": "A 35-year-old man diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D) eight years ago and treated with intermittent metformin administration visited our clinic. He had a history of a spontaneously healed ureteral stones ten years ago. He was 169.3 cm tall, weighed 51.6 kg, and his body mass index (BMI) was 18 kg/m2. None of his family members had a known history of diabetes. He complained of a warm and painful lesion on his thigh for the last three weeks, but reported no recent history of trauma or injection. Initial physical examination of the painful lesion revealed tenderness and non-pitting edema of the anteromedial right thigh. His blood pressure and body temperature were 120/80 mmHg and 36.4℃, respectively. There was no leukocytosis (white blood cell count: 9,190/µL) and C-reactive protein was normal, but the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated to 62 mm/hr. His glycemic control was very poor, with an HbA1c 14.5% and postprandial glucose of 446 mg/dL. Other biochemistry values were as follows: serum creatinine 0.4 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 24 mg/dL, potassium 4.6 mmol/L, sodium 132 mmol/L, calcium 9.1 mg/dL, phosphorus 3.6 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 86 U/L, albumin 4.1 g/dL, and creatinine kinase 436 mg/dL. He had proteinuria (trace) and glycosuria (4+) on urinalysis.\nSerial blood culture showed no evidence of bacterial infection. As infectious causes were thought to be less likely, we conducted arterial and venous doppler ultrasonography of the extremity to exclude vascular problems such as deep vein thrombosis or peripheral artery disease. There was no evidence of vascular structural abnormality, but an ill-defined hyperechoic lesion and thick fluid collection in the right vastus medialis muscle was found. After four days, the amount of fluid increased, and thus fluid aspiration at the intermuscular fascial plane adjacent to the vastus lateralis was done (). The fluid was clear, watery and serous. Gram stain and culture of the fluid were negative. Magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the right thigh reflected diffuse edema around the vastus medialis with low signal intensity on T1 () and high signal intensity on T2 images (). The three-phase bone scan showed increased blood flow to the right thigh consistent with myonecrosis as shown on the thigh MRI (). The bone scan also revealed increased blood flow at the right medial tibial condyle consistent with an insufficiency fracture, which was subsequently confirmed by X-ray and MRI (). Since these clinical findings and images were highly suggestive of DMI of the right vastus medialis with insufficient fracture of the right tibial condyle, a muscle biopsy was not performed.\nDue to the early onset of disease (age 27), no obesity and no family history of T2D, we needed to clearly identify the exact type of his diabetes. Baseline C-peptide level was very low (0.1 ng/mL) and did not sufficiently rise at 6 min after glucagon stimulation test (0.3 ng/mL). Antinuclear antibodies, and anti-IA2 antibody results were not significant, but antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD Ab) were positive (2.0 U/mL). Other immunologic factors were negative. Considering his age, low BMI, positive anti-GAD Ab, and severely decreased C-peptide level, we diagnosed his diabetes as a case of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). After we examined microvascular and macrovascular diabetic complications, he was diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy and non-proliferative retinopathy of both eyes as well as microalbuminuria based on spot urine analysis (152 µg/mg Creatinine).\nWhen we evaluated the cause of the insufficiency fracture, we found that his bone mineral density (BMD) was reduced, with T-scores of -3.9 (Z-score -3.3) at L1-L4 and -2.7 (Z-score -2.3) at the femur neck. Due to the young age of the patient, we also evaluated possible etiologies of secondary osteoporosis, including hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hypogonadism, and glucocorticoid excess. 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25-[OH]D) level was also lower than the normal limits (<4 ng/mL, normal range 11.1 to 42.9) and osteocalcin level was slightly decreased (2.4 ng/mL, normal range 2.7 to 11.5). Thyroid function test was normal (free-T4 0.90 ng/dL, normal range 0.77 to 1.94 ng/dL; Thyroid stimulating hormone 2.24 µU/mL, normal range 0.30 to 4.00 µU/mL; T3 120 ng/dL, normal range 80 to 200 ng/dL), and there was no significant finding of thyroid autoantibodies. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was 19.6 pg/mL (normal range 13 to 54 pg/mL). C-telopeptide level was within normal limits (0.74 ng/mL, normal range 0.07 to 0.78 ng/mL). Testosterone and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were also within normal limits (Testosterone 2.19 ng/mL, normal range, 1.8 to 8.96 ng/mL; FSH 4.0 ng/mL, normal range, 2.8 to 9.6 ng/mL), with a slightly low luteinizing hormone level (1.3 ng/mL, normal range, 1.8 to 5.2 ng/mL).\nAntibiotics were initially prescribed, but discontinued when bacterial infection was ruled out and DMI was thought to be the most likely clinical diagnosis. Instead, the patient was treated with analgesics such as acetaminophen, application of a long leg splint and bed rest, and multiple daily injections of insulin for strict glucose control. For his osteoporotic fracture, he was administered oral vitamin D and calcium agents. After about two weeks of supportive management, the tenderness and swelling of the right anteromedial thigh gradually reduced and the patient was able to walk without help, and so the splint was removed. 3 months later, when the hyperglycemia was controlled, we have done the oral glucose tolerance test and calculated the insulinogenic index (IGI, delta insulin 30 min-0 min/delta glucose 30 min-0 min). Calculated IGI was 0 (reference range >0.5), which reflects diminished beta-cell function on glucose stimulation. On follow-up ultrasonography after 6 months, the myonecrosis of the right vastus medialis muscle was dramatically resolved and his HbA1c had improved to 5.7%. In addition, his 25-(OH)D level had risen to 58.7 ng/mL after 6 months of treatment. Five months after treatment, the patient complained of frequent injections, so we changed his insulin regimen to a premixed combination insulin injection twice a day. He is currently under follow-up at the outpatient clinic without any evidence of recurrence. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

    "question": "A 57-year-old-male patient 165 cm tall, and weighing 68 kg in the ASA 1 risk group because of numbness of his left wrist. The biochemical parameters of the patient who was scheduled for operation under regional anesthesia with the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome were as follows; Hb:14.0 mg/dL, Htc:43.0%, Plt:229000/mm3, WBC:6000/mm3, FBG:100 mg/dL, BUN:2817 mg/dL, Creatinine:0.7 mg/dL, AST:20.72 mg/dL, and ALT:12.45 mg/dL. His electrocardiogram (EKC) revealed a HR of 70 bpm with normal sinus rhythm.\nPreoperatively the patient was informed about axillary nerve blockade, and his written informed consent was obtained. He didn’t receive any preoperative premedication, and in the operating room, his standard EKG, peripheral O2 saturation (SpO2), and noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) were monitores. Using a 18 G branule a vein on the back of his left hand was punctured, and 0.09%NaCl infusion at a rate of 200 ml/hr was initiated. Right arm to be operated was positioned at 90° abduction with the torso, and forearm was flexed 90°. After cleansing the surgical field with a sterile antibacterial solution, the site was covered with sterile drape, and a single injection was made with a 22 G x 50 mm needle (Stimuplex® Braun, Melsungen, Germany). Retrograde blood was not observed during negative aspiration.\nUsing a peripheral nerve stimulator (Stimuplex A; B.Braun Melsungen AG, B.Braun Medical AG CH-6021, Germany) at an intensity of 1.5 mA the nerve was localized. When the intensity of the electrical current was reduced to 0.5 mA, nervous stimuli were observed which made us to think that we were on the innervation site of the nerve to be blocked. Then 40 mL anesthetic solution preprepared by anesthesia technician which we thought to be our routinely used mixture i.e. [20 mL 1% lidocaine (2 ampoules of 2% lidocaine, and 10 mL NaCl 0.09%) and 20 mL 1% prilocaine (10 mL 2% prilocaine, and 10 mL0,09% NaCl)] was injected to the patient with negative suctions after each application of 5 mL. Injection site was compressed for 5 minutes. Nearly 10 minutes later the patient felt numbness on his tongue, irritability, restlessness, agitation, he uttered meaningless words, and moved his arms, and legs senselessly. Decreased peripheral oxygen saturation and presence of peripheral cyanosis led us to make an initial diagnosis of methemoglobinemia, and supportive O2 therapy was initiated via oxygen mask at a rate of 6 lt per minute. We couldn’t measure methemoglobin levels because of lack of necessity facilities. Arterial blood gas measurements were as follows. pH: 7.43 pO2:60.1, and pCO2:44.0. Respiratory distress of the patient increased, and deepened, with a drop in his SpO2 to 76, was intubated under 1 mg/kg propofol, 1 µ/kg fentanyl, and 0.5 mg.kg−1 rocuronium anesthesia to enjure the patency of his airway. For the post-intubation maitenance of anesthesia 50 oxygen –nitrogen, and 1 mac sevoflurane were used. Following induction of anesthesia, hypotension (NIBP: 60/40 mmHg), and bradycardia (HR:40 bpm) developed which required administration of 0.5 mg atropin, and intermittent IV injections of ephedrine (total dose 30 mg). When his health state was stabilized, NIBP values improved, and his HR dropped to 70 bpm with SpO2: 95%, he was amenable for surgery. At the end of the operation which lasted for nearly half an hour, the patient was awakened with injections of 10 µg/kg atropine, and 40 µg/kg neostigmine. Thoughy the patient still continued to articulate meaningless words, and make senseless movements, since he was more cooperative we transferred the patient into the intensive care unit.\nWhen we discerned that in place of 2% lidocaine ampoule which we always requested as a local anesthetic from the pharmacy, 10% lidocaine ampoule was sent, and anesthetic mixture was prepared without checking whether it was 2% lidocaine, we made the diagnosis of local anesthetic intoxication related to wrong formulation of lidocaine rather than methemoglobinemia\nDuring 24-hour monitorization in the intensive care unit his hemodynamic parameters were stable, and his complaints resolved. Then the patient was traansferred to his service with relevant recommendations. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

He had just returned to\nJapan from traveling in southeastern Asia for 1 week. He had no relevant past medical\nhistory and was not on medication. He had developed pain in the right lower mandibular\narea over the past week. The pain had progressed from the neck to the chest; he\ndeveloped a high fever during his journey and could not eat or drink. In the emergency\nroom, peripheral oxygen saturation was 95% with receiving oxygen at 15 L/min via an\noxygen mask and a reservoir bag. A chest X-ray showed a slightly widened mediastinum\nwith pleural effusion (). An\nECG revealed widespread ST-elevation (). Physical examination revealed a body mass index of 23.0 kg/m2\n(height 168.0 cm; weight 65.0 kg), blood pressure of 121/68 mmHg, average heart rate of\n110/min, respiratory rate of 40 breaths/min, body temperature of 37.9°C, and\ntenderness and redness in the anterior and bilateral sides of the neck.

Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were 45 mg/dL (ref.\n8–20 mg/dL) and 1.06 mg/dL (ref. 0.65–1.07 mg/dL), respectively. Lactate\ndehydrogenase was elevated to 510 U/L (ref. 124–222 U/L). Creatine kinase and\ncreatine kinase-MB were 269 (ref. 59–248 U/L) and 11.6 (ref. 0.0–12.0\nU/L), respectively. The fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels were normal. Although\nthese findings indicated the possibility of acute pericarditis, an ECG did not show any\nfindings of pericarditis or myocardial dysfunction.

    "question": "A 61-year-old Caucasian man presented to the emergency department in autumn with one week of dyspnea, productive cough, myalgia, and fever. He denied any chest pain or hemoptysis. His past medical history was significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma with receipt of an allogeneic stem cell transplant 13 years prior. Given prior complications due to graft versus host disease, he was receiving prednisone at a maintenance dose of 15 mg daily for several years. He had multiple documented allergies to penicillin, sulfa drugs, macrolides and fluoroquinolones, with reported reactions including rash, hives, and anaphylaxis. Approximately one week prior to the onset of symptoms, he was traveling in the Midwest United States with his partner and staying in various hotels.\nUpon arrival to the hospital, he was noted to have a heart rate of 130 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 128/76 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 89% requiring eight liters of supplementary oxygen, and an oral temperature of 39.8°C (103.6°F). He was in acute respiratory distress and had evident decreased breath sounds and crackles bilaterally. He was noted to have normal heart sounds without any murmurs, rubs, or gallops. He did not have any rash on examination.\nLaboratory investigations revealed a normal peripheral leukocyte count of 10.4 x 109 cells/L (10.4 x 103 cells/µL) , decreased hemoglobin of 110 g/L (11.0 g/dL), decreased platelet count of 96 x 109 cells/L (96 x 103 cells/µL), and increased creatinine of 676 µmol/L (7.65 mg/dL). His liver enzymes were normal. His initial chest radiograph revealed diffuse, bilateral air space opacities in the mid and lower lung zones (Figure ).\nTwo sets of blood cultures were collected and sputum samples were sent for culture as well as stains and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for Pneumocystis jirovecii (P. jirovecii). A nasopharyngeal sample was collected for respiratory virus PCR testing for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, and metapneumovirus. In addition, a serum cytomegalovirus (CMV) PCR and Legionella urine antigen were sent. He was empirically started on meropenem, vancomycin, oseltamivir, and intravenous pentamidine.\nDespite initiation of broad spectrum antimicrobials, he continued to deteriorate with increasing oxygen demands, persistent fever, hemodynamic instability, and worsening radiographic infiltrates (Figure ).\nSputum and blood cultures were negative for any bacterial growth; sputum stains and PCR were negative for P. jirovecii. His serum CMV PCR was negative. His nasopharyngeal swab for respiratory virus testing was negative for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, and metapneumovirus; however, his Legionella urine antigen was positive.\nAccording to his pharmacy records, he had previously received and tolerated a five-day course of moxifloxacin approximately one year prior to this hospital admission. Given his diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease, intravenous moxifloxacin therapy was initiated. However, shortly following receipt of his first dose of moxifloxacin, he developed an allergic reaction with a generalized, erythematous, maculopapular rash and angioedema, necessitating administration of epinephrine.\nGiven his documented allergies to both fluoroquinolones and macrolides, hemodynamic instability, and concern for poor gastrointestinal absorption of oral antimicrobials, he was subsequently treated with intravenous tigecycline with an initial, loading dose of 100 mg, followed by 50 mg twice daily for a total of 14 days of therapy. Intravenous doxycycline is not readily available in our institution. His oxygen requirements decreased and fever resolved following 48 hours of treatment with tigecycline. All other antimicrobials were discontinued once the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was made. There was no recurrence of infection after three months of follow-up; his repeat chest radiograph showed resolution of his bilateral air space opacities.\nLater in discussion with the North Dakota Department of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it was determined that there was an ongoing outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease associated with five cases over a 13-month period; all cases including our patient had stayed at the same hotel. Subsequent environmental testing of the hotel was negative, but this may have been impacted by a recent deep clean of the hotel’s ventilation system.

Her heart, lungs, and abdomen examinations showed no significant abnormalities, no percussion pain in her kidney area, and severe pitting edema in both lower extremities.\nRoutine urine examination revealed the following: Proteinuria +++, hematuria ++; phase of urinary red blood cells: Deformed erythrocytosis 70%, urine protein quantitation 4.2 g/24 h; urea nitrogen 15.7 mmol/L, and serum creatinine 141.4 μmol/L. Routine blood test results were as follows: Hemoglobin 92 g/L, white blood cells 4.8 × 109/L, blood platelets 218 × 109/L, antinuclear antibody 1:3200, cytoplasmic granules 1:1000, ds-DNA antibody > 1:3200, C3 0.56 g/L, and C4 0.22 g/L.\nPathological results showed 35 glomeruli in the punctured renal tissue, including one with global sclerosis, two with ischemic sclerosis, and the remaining glomeruli with diffuse proliferation of mesangial cells and endothelial cells, accompanied by segmental dual-track formation of a thickened basement membrane, segmental Meyer's loop, leukocyte infiltration, and segmental microthrombus formation. Fuchsinophilic protein deposition can be found at the mesangial region and subepithelial region, including fibrin crescent formation of one cell. The kidney tubular epithelium exhibited granular and vacuolar degeneration, as well as multifocal atrophy. The renal interstitium showed multishaped lymphocyte and monocyte infiltration, together with mild thickening of the arteriole wall. Paraffin immunofluorescence revealed: Immunoglobulin (Ig) G (++), IgA (++), IgM (++), C3 (+), fall risk assessment (+), C1q (++), and granular deposition along the mesangial region and capillary wall. Combined with clinical findings, this condition was considered diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis, with IV-G (A), AI = 11, and CI = 5. AI was scored as follows: Cellular proliferation (2 points), leukocyte infiltration (1 point), nuclear fragmentation/fibrinoid necrosis (2 points), cell crescent (0 points), Meyer's loop/thrombus (2 points), and interstitial monocyte infiltration (2 points). CI was scored as follows: Sclerosis (2 points), fibrin crescent (0 points), tubular atrophy (2 points), and interstitial fibrosis (2 points) (Figure ).\nAfter consideration of the renal puncture results, oral administration of prednisone was begun at 50 mg/d, and meanwhile, cyclophosphamide was applied through intravenous injection at a dosage of 1.0 g monthly, which lasted for a consecutive 6 mo and was stopped after an accumulative use of 6 g. The serum creatinine fluctuated within an approximate range of 120-160 μmol/L, and blood albumin fluctuated from approximately 29-35 g/L. Then, the patient began to take AZA 50 mg/d as maintenance treatment but experienced extensive alopecia and shedding of pubic hair on the 13th day after oral administration. Pharyngalgia appeared on the 14th day, and fever with a body temperature up to 42 ℃ occurred on the 15th day. The patient came to the hospital for the second time. Physical examination revealed the following: Body temperature, 39.4 ℃; pulse, 92 times/min; breath rate, 22 times/min; blood pressure, 182/100 mmHg. The patient exhibited clear consciousness and emotional distress; she presented scattered chromatosis on her skin, and a rash was found on the inner surface of the bilateral thighs. Pharyngeal congestion was noted, and the breath sounds of the two lungs were clear. The heart rate was 92 times/min. The abdomen was flat, soft, and free from tenderness or rebound tenderness, and there was no liver or spleen involvement. Routine blood work showed the following: Hemoglobin 72 g/L, white blood cell count 1.25 × 109/L, blood platelet count 13 × 109/L, lymphocyte ratio 95.7%, neutrophil ratio 1.6%, and neutrophil count 0.01 × 109/L (Figure ). The results of the bone marrow biopsy were as follows: Myelodysplasia low in the myelogram and focal hyperplasia in bone marrow tissue with active hyperplasia in some areas (Figure ). Routine urinalysis results were as follows: Protein (+), occult blood 2+, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positivity (3.58 × 104). TPMT genotyping testing (four single nucleotide polymorphisms, single base extension method) revealed the following: TPMT 3C gene polymorphism (719A>G) (this site is the most common gene mutation site in Asians) test result: A/A; TPMT 3B gene polymorphism (460G>A) test result: G/G; TPMT 2 gene polymorphism (238G>C) test result: G/G; no abnormity was found in any of the above results.

    "question": "A 58-year-old Thai female patient with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus was infected with HIV 1.5 years ago. She had been taking antiretroviral drugs including tenofovir, emtricitabine, and boosted darunavir thereafter and achieved virological control after 6 months of therapy. Her CD4-positive T-lymphocyte count was 532/mm3 (40%). Her other medications were amlodipine 5 mg/day, enalapril 10 mg/day, fenofibrate 300 mg/day, and metformin 500 mg/day. She gradually developed anorexia, nausea, and fatigue over two weeks' duration. She also noticed a decrease in her daily urine volume and new-onset nocturia together with swelling in both of her legs particularly in the evening. She reported no fever, rash, or joint pain. She denied taking over-the-counter medication or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. On examination, she was alert and had normal vital signs except for mild hypertension (body temperature 37.0°C, pulse rate 70/min, respiratory rate 16/min, and blood pressure 140/70 mmHg). She also had mildly pale conjunctivae and pitting edema in both of her legs. Laboratory tests showed severe azotemia (BUN 21.4 mmol/L, Cr 1,370 µmol/L) compared to baselines labs 1 month earlier (Cr 124 µmol/L). She also had hyponatremia, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, and elevated muscle enzyme (sodium 127 mEq/L, potassium 5.5 mEq/L, chloride 94 mEq/L, bicarbonate 10 mEq/L, and creatine phosphokinase 1,904 U/L; normal value 22–165 U/L). Urinalysis revealed isosthenuria, albuminuria, leukocyturia, and microhematuria without dysmorphic RBC (specific gravity 1.010, proteinuria 2+, glucose negative, WBC 3–5/hpf, and RBC 20–30/hpf). Renal ultrasonography demonstrated normal size but mildly increased parenchymal echogenicity of both kidneys without hydroureter or hydronephrosis. AKI was diagnosed. Differential diagnoses of AKI included tenofovir-induced ATN, HIV-associated nephropathy/immune complex glomerulonephritis, and rhabdomyolysis.\nRRT was initiated soon after admission due to uremia and volume overload. After successful insertion of flexible double-cuff PD catheter, automated PD (Homechoice cycler; Baxter) using total dialysate (Dianeal; Baxter) volume of 10 L was started (fill volume of 2 L, five cycles, therapy time 12 hours) on the first day of admission resulting in adequate control of fluid, electrolytes, and acid-base balance. The doses of PD by total weekly Kt/V and total weekly CCr were 3.63 and 91.94 L/week, respectively. Renal biopsy was later performed revealing evidence of acute granulomatous interstitial nephritis (AIN) and ATN without evidence of glomerular or vascular injury. Antiretroviral drugs-induced ATN/AIN was diagnosed. The attending physician then switched antiretroviral regimen to stavudine/lamivudine/boosted darunavir regimen. During fourth week of admission, her urine volume had increased to 0.8–1.0 L per day but the measured renal CCr was still low (6.62 mL/min/1.73 m2). She was discharged from the hospital anyway and was prescribed to continue automated PD during night time at home (night intermittent PD; NIPD) at a similar dose (fill volume of 2 L, five cycles, therapy time 12 hours). Eventually, PD was successfully discontinued 9 months after the onset of AKI in August 2014. At that time, her serum Cr was 159 µmol/L, and measured renal CCr was stable at 17.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 with daily urine volume of 2,480 mL. Afterwards, she remained in chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4 with stable renal function for another whole year.

    "question": "A 66-year-old man (body height, 168 cm; body weight, 88.5 kg) experienced dyspnea, a sensation of chest tightness, and back pain for a few days before he was brought to our hospital on an emergency basis. His symptoms became aggravated suddenly as he was about to get off a taxi on his way home from work. He presented with a history of close contact with a coworker with COVID-19 and was waiting for instructions from a public health center.\nIn the ambulance, the following conditions were documented: Glasgow Coma Scale score, E4V5M6; heart rate, 80/min and irregular; blood pressure, 100/60 mmHg; body temperature, 38.4ºC; oxygen saturation, 98% (O2 delivered with reservoir mask at a rate of 15 L/min). On admission, his white blood cell count was 22,300/µL; hemoglobin, 14.7 g/dL; platelet count, 35 × 104/µL; creatinine level, 2.23 mg/dL; creatine kinase level, 2582 IU/L; creatine kinase myocardial band level, 164 ng/mL; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, 97 mg/dL; high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol level, 19 mg/dL; triglyceride level, 173 mg/dL; hemoglobin A1c level, 7.9%; C-reactive protein level, 13.8 mg/dL; troponin T level, 9.640 ng/mL; N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level, 11753 pg/mL; procalcitonin level, 0.62 ng/mL; d-dimer level, 16.34 µg/mL; and soluble fibrin level, 113.1 µg/mL. An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation; ST-elevation in II, III, aVF, and V2–V6 leads; and ST depression in aVR leads (Figure ). Echocardiography revealed severe hypokinesis extending from the anterior wall to the apex and the inferior wall in left ventricle, with an approximate ejection fraction of 20%. We diagnosed STEMI and decided to perform emergency coronary angiography (CAG). A chest radiograph showed infiltrative shadows in both lungs and tracheal intubation was performed in the emergency outpatient unit (Figure ). Continuous infusion of noradrenaline (0.1 μg/kg/min) was started because his systolic blood pressure dropped below 80 mmHg. After heparin (5,000 U) was administered intravenously, the patient was transferred to the cardiac catheterization room.\nCAG was performed by cardiologists, emergency physicians, clinical engineers, nurses, and radiological technologists who donned appropriate personal protective equipment before entering the room. CAG revealed total occlusion of the middle of the right coronary artery (RCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD; Figure ). After a loading dose of dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, 162 mg; clopidogrel, 300 mg), an intra-aortic balloon pump catheter was inserted, and a 7-Fr guiding catheter was inserted into the left coronary artery. We removed white material, which did not at a first glance appear to be a typical thrombus, with an aspiration catheter, but blood flow did not improve. The onset-to-device time and door-to-device time were 116 and 84 minutes, respectively. Subsequent intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) revealed several structures, which were thought to be thrombi; therefore, we performed plain old balloon angioplasty (Figure ). After the balloon was expanded, blood flow improved slightly in the LAD but not distally. Next, we placed an everolimus-eluting stent (4.0 × 38 mm) in the middle of the LAD, but peripheral blood flow was still not observed. Repeated IVUS revealed severe stenosis caused by plaque with thrombi. An additional balloon was inflated at the distal site, and a cutting balloon was also used. Another everolimus-eluting stent (2.25 × 38 mm) was placed at the distal site, but no blood flow improvements were seen angiographically.\nWe moved a double-lumen catheter to the distal LAD and performed CAG from the distal LAD, which revealed retrograde blood flow up to the middle of the LAD and collateral circulation from the septal branch to the RCA. Repeated IVUS examination revealed thrombi and plaque at the distal end of the stent and no intrastent blood flow (Figure ). Then, we tried to perform PCI for the total occlusion of RCA, but it was unsuccessful. At this point, 7 hours passed since the patient entered the cardiac catheterization room, and so we finished the procedure. The levels of activated clotting time during PCI were maintained at 280–310 seconds. After PCI, pathological examination proved the aspirated white material was white thrombi. Chest computed tomography performed after PCI showed ground-glass opacities distributed unevenly in both the lungs, as well as left-sided pleural effusion (Figure ). After the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, he showed pulseless electrical activity, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated. Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved with 1 mg of epinephrine and one cycle of CPR. Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was considered, but his family decided against it. The blood pressure was maintained through the continuous administration of noradrenaline, dobutamine, and adrenaline. His nasopharyngeal swab was tested with polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2, and COVID-19-related pneumonia was diagnosed. Remdesivir treatment was initiated at a dose of 200 mg/day on the 5th day of hospitalization and continued at 100 mg/day. Because of the possibility of concomitant bacterial pneumonia, ampicillin sodium/sulbactam sodium (9 g/day) was also administered. However, the patient's oxygenation level worsened, and he died on the 7th day. It was difficult to confirm a main cause of death because we were not permitted to dissect patients due to COVID-19. We assumed that he had died from both cardiogenic shock due to myocardial infarction and septic shock due to covid-19 infection. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI.

    "question": "A 43-year old male presented with a history of proteinuria discovered on a routine medical examination in 1985 when he was 22 years old. His medical history was acute pancreatitis at age 17 and hypertension at age 40, and the family history indicated that his nephew had IgA nephropathy. The patient occasionally consumes alcohol, but doesn’t smoke. The patient visited a local doctor and underwent a renal biopsy for suspected active nephritis because of the finding (Table ) of hematuria 3+ protein from pooled urine 0.78 g/day and a plasma creatinine (Cr) level of 1.16 mg/dl [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 71 ml/min/1.73 m2]. Pathologic examination revealed IgA nephropathy with partial cellular crescent formation in 1 of the 12 glomeruli, slight mesangial matrix expansion, and mild atrophy of the renal tubule and interstitium. He was followed up without treatment, and the urinary abnormalities resolved spontaneously. He stopped visiting the hospital 3 years after the first visit because of the repeated negative urine analysis and did not visit any other hospital thereafter. He continued to undergo routine medical examinations, which were intermittently positive for microhematuria and proteinuria. His next visit to a medical institution was in 2002 at 38 years of age and revealed urine protein 2+, urine occult blood 1+, plasma Cr 1.13 mg/dl and hypertension. An angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) was started. After that, he saw a doctor regularly, but hematuria and proteinuria became gradually worse. A relapse of IgA nephropathy was suspected. In March 2009, he was admitted to a hospital for renal biopsy to evaluate the progression of IgA nephropathy.\nThe patient's general condition at the time of hospitalization was height 163.0 cm, weight 55.0 kg, body mass index 20.7 kg/m2, blood pressure 116/72 mmHg, heart rate 83 beats/min and temperature 36.6 °C. He was lucid with no sign of anemia in the palpebral conjunctiva. No swelling of the throat, abnormal chest auscultation, hard and tender points in the abdominal area or edema of the extremities was observed. Medical examinations (Table ) revealed urine protein 3+ (0.90 g/day), urine occult blood 3+ (RBC 10–19/HPF) and serum Cr 1.63 mg/dl.\nRenal biopsy (Fig. ) showed 4 global scleroses, 3 cellular crescent formations and 3 adhesions in 28 glomeruli; moderate expansion of the mesangial matrix; moderate tubular atrophy with mild cell infiltration in the interstitium; and moderate arteriolosclerosis and thickening of interlobular arteries. Immunostaining of IgA confirmed the diagnosis of active chronic-progressive IgA nephropathy.\nAfter admission, the patient was treated with tonsillectomy and steroid pulse therapy. Steroid pulse therapy was given as follows: methylprednisolone was administered continuously at a pulsed dose of 500 mg/day for 3 days, followed by oral prednisolone at a dose of 30 mg continuously for 3 weeks. After completion of the third course, oral prednisolone was initiated at a dose of 30 mg/day every other day after treatment and tapered by 5 mg every 2 months. The after-treatment follow-up was continued for 1 year. The patient underwent tonsillectomy after discharge from the hospital (day 75) and was then followed up at the outpatient clinic. He completed oral prednisolone treatment in approximately a year, but continued taking an ARB during the follow-up period. Clinical remission was achieved 7 months after the initiation of therapy (Table ), and hematuria and proteinuria were no longer observed in this 3-year follow-up period (Fig. ).

    "question": "A 55-year-old previously healthy man from the western province of Sri Lanka was admitted to Colombo South Teaching Hospital (CSTH) 18 h after an HNV bite. He was initially managed in a peripheral hospital and later transferred as he was anuric for 8 h. He also had vomiting and loose stools. Fang marks were seen on the fifth left toe with pain, minimal swelling and two blisters on the dorsum of the foot. The killed snake was identified by the medical officer as an HNV. He was conscious and rational with a pulse rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure 150/100 mmHg and oxygen saturation of 98%. There was no bleeding tendency or neurological manifestations. Bedside whole blood clotting time was less than 20 min on admission to the peripheral hospital and at 18 h when seen at the CSTH. Polyvalent antivenom was not given as it is ineffective in neutralizing HNV toxicity and carry a high risk of side effects.\nInitial investigations revealed, haemoglobin 13.2 g/dl, white cells 13.2 × 109/L, platelets 68 × 109/L, serum sodium 143 mmol/L, serum potassium 4.2 mmol/L and serum creatinine 3.2 mg/dl. On the 2nd day, haematological investigations revealed, haemoglobin 10.5 g/dl, white blood cells 14.1 × 109/L and platelets 58 × 109/L, whole blood clotting time > 20 min, PT/INR 1.7 (reference range: < 1.1) and APTT 48 s (30–40s). Total bilirubin 62.14 μmol/L (5–21) with direct bilirubin 10.08 μmol/L (< 3.4), serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 171 U/L (10–40), serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 808 U/L (10–35), Creatine kinase (CK) 750 U/L (15–105), serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 2370 U/L (230–460) and serum creatinine was 409 μmol/L (70–120). Blood picture revealed fragmented red cells and thrombocytopenia suggestive of microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA). In view of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), he was transfused with fresh frozen plasma with the improvement of INR and APTT. The patient was commenced on haemodialysis due to acute kidney injury (AKI).\nOn the 3rd day, he became tachypneic with de-saturation and blood gases revealed PH 7.21, PCO2 45 mmHg, PO2 31 mmHg HCO3 12.4 mEq/L. He was intubated and started on mechanical ventilation. Bleeding through the endotracheal tube was noted but there was no bleeding from elsewhere. Chest x-ray revealed bilateral alveolar shadowing suggestive of pulmonary haemorrhages (Fig. ). At this time his platelet count was 56 × 109/L, INR 1.1, APTT 40 s, thrombo-elastometry showed only a deficiency of platelets. Due to the life-threatening nature of the situation, he was commenced on intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g pulse therapy daily along with FFP and platelet transfusions. There was a rapid improvement of hypoxia with the resolution of chest x-ray changes during the next 48 h. We discontinued steroid therapy after 3 days as there was no further bleeding and chest x-ray changes were resolving (Fig. ).\nBecause of, persistent TMA as evidenced by a further drop in haemoglobin (8 mg/dl) and platelets (28 × 109/L) plasmapheresis was commenced and continued for 6 cycles. Despite the effective treatment of TMA, the patient went on to develop dry gangrene of toes on both feet (Fig. ). Renal function did not improve and required long term maintenance haemodialysis. He underwent renal transplantation 11 months after the incident due to end-stage renal disease.

    "question": "A 73-year-old Caucasian male presented to the Emergency Department (ED) in June 2008 with a history of collapse without loss of consciousness while mobilizing to the toilet in the early hours of the morning. This occurred on the background of a 6 day history of general unwellness. He was conscious and orientated on arrival but was slightly drowsy. Other than clinical features of dehydration and mild central abdominal adiposity with a waist: hip ratio of 1.04, there were no other significant clinical signs. His random plasma glucose (RPG) on arrival was 59.1 mmol/L. His height was 1.76 meters (m) and weight was 90 kilograms (kg) making the body mass index (BMI) 29.0 kg/m2. The patient was previously fit and well without any known co-morbidities. He was on no regular medication. There was no family history of diabetes or other significant conditions. He was a non-smoker and consumed no alcohol. He works as a farm equipment evaluator. There was no history of specific weight loss over the preceding months. His general practitioner (GP) had performed a fasting plasma glucose test on him in February 2008 which showed a value of 6.4 mmol/L. This was repeated within 2 weeks and the repeated value was 6.1 mmol/L. Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was also done and was 6.3%. Subsequent 75 gram (g) oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) produced a value of 15.3 mmol/L, 14.1 mmol/L and 7.6 mmol/L 30 minutes, 1-hour and 2-hours post glucose load respectively. He was managed with dietary modification and exercise.\nHis sodium (Na) was 150 mmol/L, potassium (K) 4.6 mmol/L, urea 26.1 mmol/L and creatinine (Cr) 237 micromol/L. Calculated osmolality was 394.4 mOsm/kg. Arterial blood gas sampling (ABG) showed a pH of 7.36, pCO2 4.9 kPa, pO2 11.0 kPa, bicarbonate 20 mmol/L and BE -1 mmol/L. Lactate was mildly elevated at 1.4 mmol/L. β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) was slightly elevated at 3.67 mmol/L. Repeat HBA1c was 8.1%. Besides a small amount of ketones and glycosuria, urine testing revealed nil else of concern. Full septic screen was done; white cell count (WCC) and differential showed mildly raised WCC at 12.5 × 109 and neutrophils at 10.9 × 109 with the rest of differential count being normal, CRP was 4, urine microscopy, culture and sensitivity was normal and chest radiograph was normal. Thyroid function was normal. Lipid profile was also normal.\nThe patient was diagnosed with T2DM based on his presentation, age and absence of anti-Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase 65 (Anti-GAD 65), Insulinoma Antigen-2 (IA-2) and Islet Cell (ICA) antibodies. His acute presentation was consistent with hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) and acute renal failure secondary to dehydration. He was treated with intravenous insulin and intensively rehydrated with close attention to electrolyte balance. He improved considerably and renal function normalized. He was started on Metformin 500 mg twice daily (BID) increasing to 1 g BD and Penmix 30 subcutaneous insulin at a dose of 12 units BD increasing to 30 units BD. 5 days after the acute event, a 1 mg intravenous (IV) glucagon stimulation test was done at 9.00 am with blood samples for glucose and C-peptide taken at baseline, 5, 10 and 15 minutes.\nPatient had been fasted for 15 hours overnight and medications were withheld until after the test. The glucose values were 6.3 mmol/L, 15.1 mmol/L, 16.3 mmol/L and 16.6 mmol/L at baseline, 5, 10 and 15 minutes respectively. Corresponding C-peptide values were 0.21 nmol/L, 0.42 nmol/L, 0.47 nmol/L and 0.51 nmol/L respectively. He was finally discharged after 7 days of hospital care with clinic follow up in 2 months. His average capillary blood glucose (CBG) was 6.7 mmol/L and range 6.5-7.7 mmol/L on discharge.

He was previously visiting another endocrinologist in the town but because of a change of job, he moved into the city. He brought a letter specifying that his glucose control had been acceptable since the diagnosis of diabetes (HbA1c lower than 7%). Recently, he was diagnosed of incipient nephropathy (microalbuminuria 200 mg/24 hours), high systolic blood pressure (140 mmHg), high LDL cholesterol (134 mg/dL), and retinal hard exudates close to the macula treated with laser photocoagulation. His current medication included metformin (2.550 mg/day), Detemir insulin (50 U/day), premeals Aspart insulin, simvastatin (20 mg/day), Candesartan (16 mg/day), and AAS (100 mg/d). Physical examination revealed the following: weight of 120 Kg, height of 174 cm, body index mass of 30,27 Kg/m2, blood pressure of 150/75 mmHg, and normal auscultation. The skin of the upper back and posterior neck was erythematous, indurated, and painless () with moderate restriction of range of motion of the shoulders and neck.\nBlood analysis revealed the following: leukocytes of 7500 μL, haemoglobin of 16,3 g/dL, platelets of 281000 μL, sedimentation glomerular rate of 10 mm, glucose of 135 mg/dL, creatinine of 0,3 mg/dL, cholesterol of 157 mg/dL, HDL-c of 58 mg/dL, LDL-c of 81 mg/dL, triglycerydes of 90 mg/dL, C peptide of 3,8 ng/mL, TSH of 1,78 μUI/mL, negative antithyroid antibodies, microalbuminuria of 240 mg/24 h, and HbA1c of 6,7%. The serum protein electrophoresis was normal, excluding monoclonal gammopathy.\nWhen we noticed the lesion on the skin and asked about it, the patient explained that for the last 10 years he had noticed a progressive hardening of the skin of this area, that became less sensitive, and he also noticed a decrease in motility of his neck and shoulders. He did not remember if he was febrile 10 years ago when the lesion appeared on his back. He had never been studied for the skin disorder that he related with his obesity. The patient was sent to the dermatologist who suspected the diagnosis of scleredema and performed a skin biopsy. Histopathologic study demonstrated thick collagen bundles separated by spaces filled with mucin in the deep reticular dermis, consistent with scleredema adultorum of Buschke (). He recommended physiotherapy and UV-A1 therapy. The latter treatment was not made because of a lack of this modality of phototherapy in his town, then he started PUVA therapy.\nAfter two months of PUVA therapy (total cumulative UVA dose 120 J/cm2) and physical exercises, the patient has noticed amelioration of the mobility of the back and shoulders, and on exploration, the redness of the upper back has disappeared, and the skin was softer.

    "question": "A 58-year-old Chinese female was admitted to our department of neurology with weakness of both arms and legs. Two months prior to admission, she had developed weakness in her bilateral limbs as well as pain in both shoulders. So, she went to a local hospital and reported that she felt the pain ease after receiving traditional Chinese medicine therapy. However, the weakness of her limbs gradually increased. So, she came to our hospital for further diagnosis and treatment. Her past medical history included well-controlled hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, she had experienced pyrexia at times in recent years but without the detection of a raised temperature, and she did not seek diagnosis and treatment. She had no history of smoking, alcohol consumption, or recreational drug use. Her family history was unremarkable.\nOn admission, her height was 158 cm, body weight was 42 kg, body temperature was 38.9°C, pulse was regular at 122 beats/min, respiratory rate was 28 breaths/min, and blood pressure was 170/98 mm Hg. The physical examination revealed that multiple lymphadenopathies were present in the bilateral axillary and the right side of the middle neck triangle, hyperpigmentation in the abdomen, and bilateral pitting pedal edema. The neurological examination showed bilateral upper and lower limb muscle weakness. The upper and lower extremity strength scores, as determined by manual muscle testing, were 3/5 and 4/5, respectively. Tendon reflexes were absent in all extremities, and pathological reflexes were negative. The patient was lucid, and the neurological examination revealed no cranial nerve abnormalities.\nLaboratory data on admission (Table ) revealed an elevated platelet count, but the coagulation profile was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 41 mm/h (normal range 0 to 20 mm/h). The concentration of C-reactive protein was increased. The testing showed strongly raised creatine kinase (CK) activity (7845 U/L, normal range 40–200 U/L) and elevated liver enzymes in the serum. Blood tests showed a glucose level of 5.88 mmol/L and a glycosylated hemoglobin level of 7.1%. The renal function testing revealed that her creatinine level was normal, but Cystatin C was elevated, and her glomerular filtration rate was decreased. Meanwhile, her urine protein content was 133.35 mg/L (normal range 0 to 10 mg/L). Furthermore, her creatine kinase-MB, MB, and hs-TnT concentrations were significantly increased. Thyroid function tests revealed hypothyroidism. The thyroxin stimulating hormone level was 12.069 uIU/mL (normal range 0.35–4.94 uIU/mL), but the free-T3 and T4 concentrations were normal. The adrenocorticotropic hormone concentration was 3.24 pg/mL (normal range 4.7 to 48.8 pg/mL). The cortisol concentration was 1.1 ug/dL in 4pm (normal range 2.9 to 17.3 ug/dL). Human immunodeficiency virus, serology for hepatitis B and C, and tumor markers (cancer antigen 125, alphafetoprotein, careinoembryonic, carbohydrate antigen 199, cancer antigen 153, cancer antigen 242, prostate specific antigen and neuron specific enolase) were negative. Electrodiagnostic study showed that the motor conduction velocities, sensory nerve action potential, compound muscle action potential, and F wave latency were in the normal range in the bilateral median, ulnar, sural, and tibial nerves. Electromyography analysis showed there were mass abnormal spontaneous activities (fibrillation and positive sharp wave) in the left first dorsal interossei, biceps brachii, tibialis anterior, and the medial head of quadriceps femoris muscle, and myotonic potential in the left iliopsoas and tibialis anterior muscles. The neck triangle lymph node biopsy showed lymphadenosis, but the patient refused an immunohistochemical examination. On the thorax computed tomography (CT) scan, multiple enlarged axillary lymph nodes were observed (Fig. A). The flexor carpi radialis muscle biopsy showed many infiltrated lymphocytes, and the congo red staining test was negative. Combined with the symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory tests, we made a diagnosis of myositis. Hence, we treated the patient with methylprednisolone. However, she did not show a significant improvement, despite receiving standard therapy. Thus, immunoelectrophoresis was performed. Immunoelectrophoresis showed monoclonal IgA lambda serum. A bone marrow biopsy examination revealed that the plasma cell content was slightly elevated (0.84%). Furthermore, the concentrations of serum IgA and lambda free light chains were elevated. Serum IgG, IgM, and IgE levels and complements of C3, C4, and kappa free light chains were within the normal range. Furthermore, the VEGF concentration was slightly elevated. In addition, a X-ray of the skull revealed a small bone defect in the frontal lobe (Fig. B). Ultrasonography showed no cardiomegaly, hepatosplenomegaly, or pleuroperitoneal fluids. Based on the observed skin manifestations, lymphadenopathies, pedal edema, IgA-λ restricted paraproteinemia, plasma cell dyscrasia in bone marrow, elevation of VEGF, and other features, we made a diagnosis of atypical POEMS syndrome without polyneuropathy.

A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed bilateral pulmonary artery thrombi and deep venous thrombus in the lower limb (Fig. ). A transthoracic echocardiography revealed a right ventricular thrombus (Fig. ). She was referred to our hospital at 28 weeks of gestation after insertion of IVC filter and heparin administration. Fetal development was normal. Due to the mobility of right ventricular thrombus and the risk of cardiac arrest, an emergency thrombectomy was planned. An intracardiac echography probe (AcuNav™; Siemens AG, Munich, Germany) was inserted via the right femoral vein to monitor the umbilical artery pulse wave via Doppler, in addition to transabdominal fetal monitoring. After induction of anesthesia, the patient’s blood pressure was undetectable; hence, emergency cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was performed via median sternotomy, followed by cardiac resuscitation. While switching to extracorporeal circulation approximately 10 min after the hemodynamic collapse, the fetal heart rate decreased to approximately 80 beats per minute. Immediately after establishing extracorporeal circulation, the fetal heart rate recovered rapidly and remained stable throughout the procedure, while the CPB average perfusion pressure was maintained above 70 mmHg. Thrombectomy and tricuspid valve plication were performed under cardiac arrest (Fig. ). Catecholamines and nitric oxide were administered at a concentration of 20 ppm to treat hypotension and pulmonary hypertension, respectively, during withdrawal from CPB. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit without chest closure. Total time for surgery, anesthesia, cardiopulmonary, and aortic cross clamp was 345, 483, 208, and 147 min, respectively. The total volume of hemorrhage, transfusion, infusion, urine, and water balance was 1470, 3600, 2150, 1520, and +657 ml, respectively. Chest closure was performed on postoperative day 3 and extubation on postoperative day 6. Heparin administration was resumed after confirming postoperative hemostasis. At 32 weeks of gestation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to assess the fetal brain function; no remarkable changes were observed. The patient was discharged with subcutaneous injection of heparin calcium, due to persistent lower limb thrombus.\nShe was readmitted at 38 weeks of gestation. Labor was induced at 40 weeks using oxytocin, after discontinuation of heparin. Epidural anesthesia was administered to protect the thoracic wound site and reduce the cardiac load. An epidural catheter was placed between the L3-L4 vertebrae, after confirming the recovery of hemostatic function by measuring activated partial thromboplastin time. Continuous epidural ropivacaine 0.1% with 2 mcg/ml fentanyl was administered through patient controlled epidural analgesia. Analgesia was adequate throughout labor, with no hemodynamic changes. A healthy male infant weighing 3446 g (+1.07 SD) was delivered by vacuum extraction with an Apgar score of 8/8. Total delivery time was 3 h and 37 min, with total blood loss of 928 ml. No remarkable changes were observed in the neonate’s brain on CT and MRI just after delivery. The patient was prescribed oral warfarin for anticoagulation, and both mother and child were discharged without complications. What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

    "question": "A 54-year-old woman presented to her personal physician and complained the pain on her right breast. She underwent a breast surgery in our hospital. The patient and her family’s medical histories were unremarkable.\nThe patient was 157 cm tall and weighed 53 kg. Physical examination of the right breast (area C) revealed an elastic hard mass measuring 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm. Margins were distinct, with relatively good mobility and a tumor-nipple distance of 3.2 cm. No axillary or cervical lymph nodes were palpable. Hematological and biochemical blood test results were normal. The levels of tumor markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 15-3, and National Cancer Center-Stomach-439, were within normal limits.\nMammography revealed an indistinct margined hyper dense mass in the right outer portion, which was assessed as Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System category 4C (: MLO view, : CC view). Breast ultrasonography (US) revealed complex cystic lesion, and the tumor was large with 2.5 cm diameter (). Complex cystic lesion on US with blood content on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology revealed malignant cells. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and a T2 weight image revealed an early enhancement image with no intraductal spread (). No distant metastases was identified on computed tomography or bone scan. The tumor stage was T2N0M0. Breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed.\nThe results exposed two sentinel lymph nodes and no malignant cell. The tumor measured 2.0 cm in diameter and contained a central cystic area (,). Histopathological examination showed low papillary growth in the cystic cavity surface, which was covered by adenocarcinomatous components associated with some squamous metaplasia. Most of the lesions comprising the cyst wall were a mixture of irregular bundles of spindle-shaped tumor cells and fibrous connective tissue proliferation. The tumor was diagnosed as spindle cell ().\nImmunostaining of spindle-shaped tumor cells showed positive results for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) and vimentin (,), partially positive results for s-100, and negative results for desmin and α-actin. The final histopathological diagnosis was spindle cell carcinoma. Histological grade from malignancy was grade III. Lymphatic invasion was negative, whereas blood vessel invasion was positive. Lymph node metastasis was negative, and p-stage I was diagnosed. Estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2), which showed negative results by biochemical tests, were called triple negative type in subtype classification. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient received six courses of FEC-100 chemotherapy. Radiotherapy included simultaneous integrated boost enforced 60 Gy (2 Gy/day) to the residual breast tissue. After 24 months of postoperation, no recurrence has been detected.

    "question": "A 54-year-old female (weight 55 kg, 160 cm) was referred by an orthopedic surgeon to our pain clinic for persistent low back pain radiating down to right leg. She had a history of low back pain associated with radiculopathy, which was more on the right side and radiated till the big toe for more than 6 weeks. The impression on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a right paracentral disc protrusion at levels L4-L5, L5-S1 causing thecal sac indentation, effacement of the right lateral recess and right exiting nerve root impingement. There was no associated lumbar canal stenosis and no evidence of facet arthropathy. She had been taking analgesics tablet diclofenac 650 mg, tablet pregabalin 75 mg, tablet nortriptyline 10 mg, and regular physiotherapy for the last 6 weeks. She even underwent an epidural steroid injection (ESI) through the caudal route with 4 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine, 1 ml of methylprednisolone, and 5 ml of normal saline at a tertiary care center 4 weeks back after which her symptoms improved marginally for a period of 1 week and then she again started with debilitating pain, not getting relieved with analgesics and other modes of conservative management. The complete motor and sensory examination of the patient revealed motor power of Grade V, i.e. the muscle can move the joint; it crosses through a full range of motion against gravity and resistance. The sensations were intact as elicited by pain, temperature, vibration, position sense, stereognosis, and two-point discrimination. All the superficial and deep tendon reflexes were intact with an SLR of 10° on the right side and 70° on the left side. The patient had full control over the bladder and bowel.\nWe hence planned, fluoroscopic-guided transforaminal ESI (TFESI) using clonidine as an adjuvant at levels L4-L5 and L5-S1 on the right side, after discussing both with the patient and the orthopedic surgeon.\nAfter taking an informed written consent, an 18-gauge intravenous cannula was secured. All routine monitors (electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure, and oxygen saturation) were attached. The patient was positioned on the operating room table with a pillow underneath the abdomen in the prone position. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the standard safe triangle was identified with pedicle of the vertebrae forming one arm of the triangle, lateral border of vertebral body forming the second arm, and the hypotenuse being formed by the exiting nerve root. Under all aseptic precautions, the skin overlying the target area was anesthetized with 2 ml of 1% lidocaine. The level of the epidural injection was chosen depending on the MRI findings and physical examination as L4- L5 and L5-S1.\nA 22-gauge spinal needle was then advanced under fluoroscopy aiming the needle at the superior and anterior part of the intervertebral foramen through the safe triangle. The needle placement was confirmed after injecting 1–2 ml of omnipaque, nonionic water-soluble contrast medium iohexol dye, demonstrating the contrast going through the foramen. Furthermore, the confirmation of the needle position with contrast dye reduced the possibility of misplacement or intravascular placement of the needle, which is always a risk in ESIs performed without fluoroscopy. The needle was advanced into the safe triangle, and its placement was then confirmed both by anteroposterior and lateral view. One milliliter methylprednisolone (40 mg) mixed with 0.5 ml clonidine (50 μg) and 1 ml bupivacaine 0.5% were given at each level (volume 2.5 ml).\nAfter the completion of the procedure, the patient was transferred to the recovery area. The patient's hemodynamic parameters were monitored during and after the procedure. Assessment of pain relief and any motor or sensory deficit was checked immediately and then hourly after the procedure till discharge from the recovery area.\nThe patient was discharged after having met the following discharge criteria after 2 h:\nThe patient was able to walk unaided The patient was able to void her bladder without any difficulty.\nShe was assessed for any numb or weak feeling in her back or legs for a few hours after the injection.\nAfter 24 h, the patient was discharged from the hospital, and there was a significant improvement in the pain with an improvement in the SLR to 60°.\nFollowing instructions were given at the time of discharge:\nTo report any untoward incident To continue taking analgesics as advised To start back muscle strengthening exercises after 3 days if there was considerable pain relief.\nPatient was then reassessed at 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months interval after the procedure. There was a significant improvement in the pain after single injection of TFESI using clonidine as depicted by the visual analog scale (VAS) score; there was a much reduced drug dose intake and an improvement in the daily life activities as stated by the patient.

    "question": "A 76-year-old, 166-cm, 71.3-kg Asian man with chest pain of 2 months’ duration due to coronary artery disease was admitted for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) revascularization surgery. He had a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. He had a dilated left atrium, minimal tricuspid regurgitation, and normal left ventricular systolic function. He had no history of dysphagia or esophageal regurgitation. Preoperative magnetic resonance angiography revealed that his right internal carotid artery was severely occluded. The neurologist recommended a right carotid endarterectomy before CABG. The right carotid endarterectomy was performed uneventfully 2 days before CABG, and the total anesthesia time was 3 h 30 minutes.\nA peripheral intravenous catheter was inserted into the left forearm, and an arterial catheter was inserted at the right radial artery. Anesthesia was induced with remifentanil 32 μg, propofol 120 mg, and rocuronium 70 mg. We inserted an OmniPlane TEE probe (Philips Medical Systems, Andover, MA, USA) into the esophagus without any difficulty or resistance. TEE examination was done with the CABG procedure. For patient safety, the comprehensive intraoperative TEE guidelines of the American Society of Echocardiography Council for Intraoperative Echocardiography and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists Task Force were followed.\nThe CABG was successful. The cardiopulmonary bypass time was 105 minutes. During cardiopulmonary bypass, the patient’s temperature was lowered to 33.0 °C at the rectum (33.0 °C at the nasal membrane). The TEE probe was in a neutral position in the upper esophagus and frozen to prevent injury. The average pump flow rate was 2.4 L/minute/m2. At the end of the procedure, the patient was rewarmed to 36.3 °C at the rectum (36.8 °C at the nasal membrane) for 60 minutes. During rewarming, TEE examination was performed, and the temperature of the TEE probe was increased to 39 °C. The TEE examination was discontinued intermittently and automatically to reduce the probe temperature. During the TEE examination, any movement or manipulation was gentle. Dopamine and nitroglycerin were given during weaning from bypass. The TEE probe was removed at the end of anesthesia. It was clean with no signs of blood. Extubation was done 11 h postoperatively.\nThe patient developed intermittent fever on the first postoperative day. Leukocytosis (19,440 white blood cells/μl) and a high level of C-reactive protein (30.0 mg/dl) were detected in the postoperative laboratory examination. The patient’s fever ranged from 37.0 °C to 38.3 °C and did not subside until postoperative day 3, despite empirical treatment with tazobactam and ciprofloxacin. Computed tomography done to evaluate the coronary arteries incidentally found signs of abscess formation or air-containing tissue in the retrosternal, pericardial, and paraesophageal areas (Fig. ). Esophagography revealed contrast leakage in the right wall of the middle esophagus (Fig. ). The patient’s hemodynamic variables, including blood pressure and heart rate, remained stable and were monitored closely. The patient was managed conservatively with fasting, parenteral nutrition, and intravenous antibiotics. We were prepared for surgical intervention, such as open esophageal repair or endoscopic primary repair, if there was any indication of unstable vital signs. The patient’s postoperative fever abated on postoperative day 4. Follow-up esophagography disclosed no change in the esophageal lesion. The patient was allowed to drink sips of water 35 days postoperatively. On postoperative day 39, he began a normal diet. He was discharged without complications on postoperative day 42.

These symptoms occurred when she lifted a heavy suitcase. She had visited an orthopedic doctor and received a caudal block 4 days prior, followed by a high-grade fever and deteriorating low back pain starting 1 day prior. Her medical history included surgery to enlarge both breasts when she was 14 years old. She was not taking any medicines on a regular basis. She had a smoking history of five cigarettes a day starting at the age of 20, and no history of drinking alcohol. She underwent periodic medical exams, and the latest one, which had been 2 months before, appeared normal. The patient was employed at a film factory, as a product inspector, and had no food or drug allergies. She had no history of casual sex, intramuscular injections, or IV drug use.\nShe was 153 cm tall, and weighed 42 kg. Her vital signs were abnormal, with blood pressure of 104/85 mm Hg, a heart rate of 123 regular beats/min, a body temperature of 38.1 °C, oxygen saturation of 98% in ambient air, and a respiratory rate of 16/min; her Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15 (E4V5M6) points. She complained of percussion tenderness to the lower thoracic vertebra and the upper sacral bone. Her manual muscle testing score for the left lower limb was 4; on the other hand, nothing else abnormal, including skin or neurologic findings, was detected upon physical examination.\nA routine laboratory examination of the patient revealed increased values of white blood cells, creatinine, C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and decreased values of blood urea nitrogen and creatine kinase. On the other hand, other values were normal, including complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry, urine tests, and cerebrospinal fluid examination (). She also tested negative for rheumatoid factor, autoantibodies such as anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, serologic test for hepatitis B and C, syphilis, HIV, thyroid hormone, soluble interleukin-2 receptor, flu test, and 2/2 sets of blood culture. Head and chest-abdomen computed tomography (CT) scans and transesophageal echocardiography revealed normal results. On the other hand, a complete spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed a 0.5- mm-thick layer of spinal epidural fluid in the posterior epidural space in the whole thoracic and anterior epidural space from the L5 to S2 vertebral body level region, which compressed the epidural space (, and , respectively). These findings were revealed as low intensity in a T1-weighted image, and high intensity in a T2-weighted image. Other findings, such as discitis, were not confirmed.\nAt this point, we suspected a diagnosis of disseminated SEA, but the origin was still unknown. However, an orthopedic surgeon recommended against performing CT-guided percutaneous needle aspiration of the abscess, based on the locations of the lesions. The patient was hospitalized, and we started 13.5 mg/day of piperacillin-tazobactam, following which she gradually became symptom-free. However, on the 14th hospital day, she strongly requested that she be discharged from the hospital, so we changed her antibiotics to 500 mg/day of levofloxacin tablets, and continued treatment. During her return visit, 16 days after her discharge, she was well. We confirmed normal values of inflammation biomarkers, including WBC, CRP, and ESR, and in addition we also confirmed abscess improvements in both the thoracic and sacral regions through an MRI scan (, and , respectively). Based on these findings, we ended her treatment that day without treatment complications. What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)? Your answer should be in terms of kg/m².",

On examination she was fully conscious and oriented and complained of severe headache. Nuchal rigidity was evident. No focal neurological deficit was found. Temperature was 38°C and other vital signs were stable. Past medical history was negative and she did not consume any medication.\nCT scan of the head revealed acute subarachnoid hemorrhage prominently occupying the right sylvian fissure. CT angiography was performed (figure ). The cerebral vasculature was found to harbor three saccular aneurysms at: (1) right MCA trifurcation, (2) left ICA bifurcation, and (3) distal basilar artery. The right MCA aneurysm was presumed to be the ruptured aneurysm due to location of subarachnoid clot and irregular shape of the aneurysm.\nA right pterional craniotomy was performed with the patient in the supine position and head rotated 30 degrees to left. After elevation of the craniotomy flap, the sphenoid ridge was drilled flush with the orbital roof to facilitate exposure of the basilar tip aneurysm. After duratomy, gentle frontal lobe retraction allowed CSF drainage from the optic and carotid cisterns. Right optic nerve and right ICA were identified and the Sylvian fissure was opened from medial to lateral, following the bifurcation of right ICA to MCA trifurcation. A saccular aneurysm was found in the MCA trifurcation projecting inferolaterally. After dissection of the neck it was clipped. Next, opening the membrane of Liliequist, let to the distal basilar aneurysm from the corridor between the right optic nerve and right ICA. The aneurysm was located between the right PCA and right SCA with a wide neck, and its dome projected laterally to right. Successful clipping was achieved. The left ICA bifurcation aneurysm was identified after following the right A1, anterior communicating and left A1 arteries with minimal brain retraction, and gaining benefit from favorable neuroanesthesia.

    "question": "A 77-year-old, Asian male patient (weight: 60 kg, height: 165 cm) with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing periodic hemodialysis, was hospitalized due to acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He had no known history of psychosis prior to admission to the hospital. His social history was positive for alcohol consumption (25 mL a day for 10 years) and smoking (40 cigarettes a day for 30 years).\nOn admission, the patient was conscious and oriented to person, time, and place. Complete neurological examination including mental state was normal. The patient was in shortness of breath with the following vital signs: temperature 36.2 °C, blood pressure 156/91 mmHg, pulse 98 beats/min, and respiratory rate 20 per minute. He reported progressively worsening cough productive of yellow purulent sputum. Bilateral moist crackles were heard in both lungs on auscultation but with no wheezing. Markers of systemic inflammation were elevated (white blood cell count [WBC] 10.25 × 103/μL, C-reactive protein [CRP] 57.50 mg/L, procalcitonin [PCT] 0.49 ng/mL). Laboratory analysis revealed increased baseline serum creatinine (10.63 mg/dL, estimated creatinine clearance 4.94 mL/min). His liver function was moderately impaired and classified into Child-Pugh class B. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed diffuse inflammation and interstitial change and a small amount of pleural effusion in bilateral lungs.\nIntravenous moxifloxacin was initiated 400 mg daily as empiric treatment for pulmonary infection on hospital day 1. A sputum sample was collected for microbiological culture before initiation of antibiotics and the result came back negative. On day 12, the patient was feeling tired and weak with hyperthemia (38.1 °C), hypertension (184/91 mm Hg), and worsened shortness of breath (26 beats/min). Plasma indicators for infection were elevated (WBC 11.50 × 109/L, neutrophils 97.1%, PCT 22.10 ng/mL). On the 13th day, moxifloxacin was switched to meropenem 500 mg intravenous every 8 hours. On 16th day, sputum culture revealed multidrug-resistant (MDR) A baumannii (resistant to carbapenem but sensitive to tetracycline). Then intraveous tigecycline was added to the regimen at a loading dose of 100 mg followed by 50 mg every 12 hours.\nFourteen hours after tigecycline initiation, the patient became confused, disoriented to location, and the time. He had difficulty understanding instructions and was clearly disturbed in attention during the conversation. He was agitated, fearing that people around him were trying to harm him. Then he became verbally aggressive toward his family members and medical staff. His mental disorder worsened in the next 2 to 3 hours then he began having hallucinations, seeing a huge ball in the ceiling and asking the nurse to take it down so he could eat it. He asked other people to gather together and said he had important things to announce. His Confusion Assessment Method, which is a valid tool for the detection of delirium, was negative prior to the initiation of tigecycline, but became positive after it was started. His clinical manifestations also met the key features listed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition (DSM-V) criteria from the American Psychiatric Association that characterizes delirium.[\nNo focal neurological disease was noted after neurological examination. A computerized tomographic scan of the head was then performed, and no abnormalities were identified. Oxygen supplementation (4 L/min via nasal cannulae) was initiated after the arterial blood gas analysis showed hypoxemia (pH 7.41; PaCO2 25 mmHg; PaO2 68 mmHg; Na+ 132 mEq/L; K+ 5.5 mEq/L). The patient did not have any prior history of mental illness. Drug-induced delirium was suspected and tigecycline was speculated to be the most likely offending agent after medication review (Table ). Since his delirium was treated with little success with olanzapine, tigecycline therapy was discontinued the next morning after the patient stayed awake the whole night. During the following day after discontinuation of tigecyline, the patient's mental state improved and delirium cleared slowly. He restored the ability of focus and orientation. Perceptual disturbances disappeared, and no visual illusions or vague delusions of harm were noted again.\nMeanwhile, markers of systemic inflammation were elevated (WBC 43.91 × 109/L, neutrophils 98.2%, PCT 34.04 ng/mL, CRP 89.09 mg/L). On Day 19, antibiotic therapy was switched to meropenem (i.v., 500 mg q8 h) combined with minocycline (p.o., 400 mg q12 h), and amikacin (i.v., 200 mg qd). The regimen continued for 5 days but the patient did not respond well, showing even higher systemic inflammation markers and exacerbated dyspnea. Antibiotic therapy was switched to meropenem 500 mg every 8 hours, and he started again on tigecycline 50 mg every 12 hours on 24th day with no loading dose.\nIn the morning of Day 25, the patient showed reduced psychomotor activity, decreased speech, but no obvious hallucinations. He had no idea of the time of day, nor where he was, although the day before he was fully orientated. The patient experienced a hypoactive state of delirium. CT examination of the chest showed increased inflammatory pulmonary lesions in bilateral lungs. Blood gas analysis revealed hypoxemia without carbon dioxide retention, and the electrolytes were found to be within range. Also, no significant changes in blood profile like levels of liver enzymes or serum creatinine was observed compared with the last test taken before the delirium appeared again. Tigecycline was discontinued and delirium resolved in the afternoon. Antibiotic treatment was then switched to levofloxacin (i.v., 600 mg qd) and minocycline (p.o., 100 mg q12 h). But the patient did not respond well to the present antibiotic therapy and his dyspnea exacerbated. He was transferred to the intensive care unit 6 days later as mechanical ventilation was required. Unfortunately, the patient died of recurrent attacks of left heart failure probably caused by uncontrolled serious infections on 33th day. What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

On physical examinations, there was no limitation on range of motion of the left hip joint. Also he could walk without any pain except mild tenderness on the area distal from the ischial tuberosity. On the radiographs of the pelvis anteroposterior and frog leg view (), there was a 35×40×20 mm sized bony fragment, 15 mm distance from the left ischial tuberosity. After the patient admitted to our hospital, he had an examination of computed tomography () and magnetic resonance imaging for rule out pathologic conditions. There was a bony fragment at left ischial tuberosity, which was mainly from conjoined origin of biceps femoris and semitendinosus tendons without any bone marrow edema (). Overall, he diagnosed as old avulsion fracture at ischial tuberosity. He determined to get conservative treatment on condition of a gradual alleviation of the symptom. During the admitted 2 months, he just got rest and high intensity laser therapy. Thanks to the improvement except discomfort on running, he discharged and returned to his military unit. What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)? Your answer should be in terms of kg/m².",

    "question": "A 40-year-old woman, 169 cm, 57 kg, underwent laparoscopic right adrenalectomy due to an adrenal pheochromocytoma. Preoperative evaluation of the patient was unremarkable. General anesthesia was induced using thiopental sodium, fentanyl, vecuronium and sevoflurane. A 7.5 Fr 3-lumen catheter was inserted under ultrasonographic guidance (linear probe: UST-5546, 5-10 MHz, machine: Prosound SSD-4400®, Aloka Medical, Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) into the right internal jugular vein, and lung sliding was confirmed in both thoraces. Next, the patient was placed into the left lateral decubitus position. Before incision, ETCO2, Pmax, and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) were determined to be 33 mmHg, 17 cmH2O, and 100%, respectively. Pneumoperitoneum was established using CO2, intraabdominal pressure was maintained < 15 mmHg, and Pmax was 23 cmH2O at the time. Thirty minutes after inducing pneumoperitoneum, the ETCO2 and Pmax levels gradually increased to 43 mmHg and 30 cmH2O, respectively. Thereafter, SpO2 decreased acutely to 92%. On auscultation, the breath sounds from the left lung field were normal. However, the right side of the chest demonstrated no sounds. Immediately, the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) increased from 0.5 to 0.8, and the endotracheal tube was withdrawn back to 2 cm in order to rule out endobronchial intubation. Because the depth of the endotracheal tube was 18 cm at the incisor teeth and confirmed the depth of endotracheal tube by cuff palpation at the sternal notch, we supposed that it was enough to rule out one-lung intubation without using bronchoscope. SpO2 was maintained at between 98-100%, though the right thorax was still silent. Pneumothorax was strongly suspected, and the chest was examined using ultrasonography. Lung sliding and seashore sign were demonstrated in the left lung (), however there was no sliding with barcode sign in the right lung (). Although the surgeon simultaneously inspected the diaphragm in detail, no apparent injuries or defects were found. Because the vital signs were stable and SpO2 and ETCO2 were normal, as indicated by an increased FiO2 and respiratory rate, the operation was laparoscopically completed.\nWhen the operation was concluded, a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O was applied to inflate the collapsed lung. The patient was examined using ultrasonography whilst in the supine position, and at the same time, portable chest radiography was called to assess a pneumothroax. The ultrasonographic probe was placed on the right lower lateral chest wall between anterior and mid axillary line (), and we identified the \"lung point\" sign, which can be used to diagnose pneumothorax []. Also, chest radiography indicated a < 30% collapse of the right lung (). As the right hemithorax was continuously examined using ultrasonography, auscultation of the right lung improved, as well as the appearance of lung sliding sign and the disappearance of the lung point sign in whole right hemithorax within about 30 minutes after the end of the operation. No hemodynamic instability was noted, and SpO2 was maintained at 100% using only medical air. Hence, pneumthorax was considered to be capnothorax, and the patient was extubated without the insertion of a chest tube. The patient was transferred to the postanesthetic care unit (PACU) and did not complain about any respiratory disturbance. What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)? Your answer should be in terms of kg/m².",

The patient had been in his usual health until 1 week before this admission when pain in the left testis developed. The pain started suddenly, progressive and was associated with intermittent fever (38.2) and progressive enlargement of the left scrotum. There was no history of trauma or lower urinary tract infections symptoms or hematuria or urethral discharge. 1 week before this admission, he presented to another health center for evaluation where he was diagnosed with urinary tract infection and managed as outpatient with a prescription for 7-day course of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium. The SCA course of this patient was remarkable for recurrent vaso-occlusive crisis and splenectomy at the age of 13 years, but there were no complications such as acute chest syndrome, cerebrovascular accidents, or genitourinary complications. He is not known to have any other medical problems, and he is not on any medications currently apart from intermittent use of analgesics. His vaccinations are up to date. There is additional history for discontinuation of hydroxyurea 4 months ago for improving fertility. He was married and worked as a pharmacist. He did not smoke, drink alcohol, use illicit drugs, or any kind of herbs. He had a family history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. On examination, the temperature was 37.1°C and pulse 100 beats/min; the other vital signs were normal. The height of the patient was 163 cm and his weight was 55 kg. Swollen, red, and tender left scrotum was present. The examination was otherwise normal. Ultrasound scrotum showed heterogeneous hypoechoic left testicle with no blood flow [].\nLaboratory investigations showed white blood cells 40 (3.5–10.5 billion cells/L), hemoglobin 80 (135–170 g/L), mean corpuscular volume 80 (80–96 fl), platelets 1140 (150–450 billion/L), and reticulocytes 10.7%.

    "question": "A 57-year-old male with a 7-day history of fever and dyspnea was admitted to a local hospital and intubated for respiratory failure. COVID-19 was confirmed by a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result obtained via a nasopharyngeal swab. Thus, he was transferred as a severe COVID-19 pneumonia case in need of intensive care. He had a medical history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and asthma. His height was 173 cm and his weight was 71.6 kg.\nOn arrival, the physical examination revealed body temperature of 38°C, blood pressure of 112/47 mmHg, pulse of 106 beats/min, and respiratory rate of 14 breaths/min. He was deeply sedated (Glasgow Coma Scale score: E1VtM4) and suffered severe respiratory failure; arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.283, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) 45 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) 64 mmHg with invasive mechanical ventilation [pressure control ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 24 cmH2O, the fraction of inspired O2 (FiO2) of 0.75, inspiratory time of 1.6 s, frequency of 14/min, and the delivered tidal volume was about 470 mL]. The computed tomography scan revealed a bilateral consolidation with lower lung predominance; bulla or emphysema was not observed (Fig. ). Favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, and tocilizumab were administered for the COVID-19 treatment. As mechanical ventilation, in accordance with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) strategy, did not show sufficient improvement, prone position ventilation was also initiated. His oxygenation improved slightly but not enough; PaO2 was 78.4 mmHg with FiO2 of 0.6.\nOn the 15th day after admission, the chest X-ray suggested a giant bulla in the right lung (Fig. ). One day later, his respiratory condition deteriorated and the chest X-ray revealed the presence of severe right-sided pneumothorax (Fig. ). A 24-Fr chest drain was immediately inserted, covering the patient’s right chest with a plastic sheet and attaching an in-line filter to the suction tubing to minimize aerosolization. However, a significant air leak continued, and severe ventilator settings were still required (pressure control ventilation with PEEP of 12 cmH2O, PIP of 28 cmH2O, FiO2 of 0.6, inspiratory time of 0.9 s, frequency of 20/min, and the delivered tidal volume was about 320 mL) to compensate for the respiratory acidosis (pH 7.266, PaCO2 62.2 mmHg, PaO2 73.3 mmHg). The Murray score was 3. In addition, the pneumothorax was considered to be intractable and the continuous air leak increased the risk of medical staffs’ exposure. Thus, VV-ECMO treatment (MERA centrifugal blood pump system HCS-CFP; Senko Medical Instrument, Tokyo, Japan) was promptly initiated for lung protection at 5 h after performing the tube thoracotomy. The right internal jugular vein was cannulated with a 19-Fr heparin-coated cannula for blood return, and the right femoral vein was cannulated with a 24-Fr heparin-coated cannula for blood access. The blood flow was 4.5 L/min and sweep gas was 5.0 L/min. Heparin was given to maintain an activated partial thromboplastin time of about 50 s.\nThe PEEP was initially set to 0 cmH2O and the PIP was set to 5 cmH2O. After the air leak diminished, we gradually increased the pressure. On the 3rd day after starting ECMO, the PEEP was set to 5 cmH2O and the PIP was set to 10 cmH2O. On the 7th day, the PEEP was set to 8 cmH2O and the PIP was set to 12 cmH2O. On the 10th day, during the sweep gas off test, the arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.383, PaCO2 49.4 mmHg, PaO2 81.7 mmHg with PEEP of 10 cmH2O, PIP of 22 cmH2O, FiO2 of 0.4, inspiratory time of 1.1 s, frequency of 18/min, and the delivered tidal volume was about 480 mL. Thus, the patient was weaned from the ECMO and the chest drain was removed on the following day with no major comorbidities.\nWe performed the PCR test every other week. The PCR test result was negative on the 31st day after admission. The patient underwent tracheostomy on the 34th day. The ventilator management was completed on the 52nd day and he was transferred for rehabilitation on the 61st day. What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

    "question": "A 65-year-old male, 155 cm tall and weighing 53 kg, was scheduled to undergo mesh cage insertion and posterior spinal fusion from T6 to L5 for severe kyphosis due to spinal tuberculosis. Preoperative chest radiography revealed severe kyphosis of the thoracolumbar spine; however, there was no active lesion in the lungs. Thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography revealed spinal fusion at the level of T9–L3, with volume decrease and deformity associated with severe kyphosis. The kyphotic angle was approximately 115 degrees (Fig. ). Preoperative pulmonary function tests revealed a mild restrictive pattern with a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 1.81 L (63% of normal), a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of 1.53 L (73% of normal), and an FEV1/FVC ratio of 85%. Preoperative electrocardiography revealed normal sinus rhythm. In the preoperative visit, the patient exhibited limited neck motion because of severe kyphosis; he was Mallampati class III.\nIn the operating room, the patient was monitored using three-lead electrocardiography, pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure monitoring, and bispectral index. Due to inability to lie on his back without any supportive devices, the head of the operating bed was raised approximately 30–40 degrees, and anesthesia was induced in the semi-recumbent position. Anesthesia was induced using a target-controlled infusion of propofol (Schnider model) and remifentanil (Minto model); rocuronium bromide 0.6 mg/kg was administered to facilitate tracheal intubation. Before tracheal intubation, preoxygenation was performed for 5 to 10 min with 100% oxygen in a face-to-face approach, with bimanual mask holding and mechanical ventilation. Although the awake intubation technique may be considered in cases of anticipated difficult intubation, the cause of difficult intubation in the present case was attributed to a kyphotic change, and not the airway itself, such as an anteriorly deviated glottis or soft tissue swelling; therefore, the authors believed that the patient’s airway could be adequately maintained using bimanual mask-holding in a face-to-face position. Initially, direct laryngoscopy and video laryngoscopy were attempted; however, it was exceedingly difficult to visualize the vocal cords because of the patient’s semi-recumbent position, his short stature, and the relatively large bed size. Moreover, a conventional lightwand technique from the head end of the patient was also difficult to perform. Although fiberoptic bronchoscopy can be considered as a first choice, it was temporarily unavailable because of an insufficient number of devices and well-trained staff. As the conventional overhead approach using laryngoscopy or lightwand was difficult, an alternative face-to-face approach using a lightwand was attempted. After all lights in the operating room were turned off, the anesthetist opened the patient’s mouth while facing him, and slowly inserted the tracheal tube-launched lightwand, of which the tip was bent at an angle of 90 degrees along the base of the tongue in the midline. The bright red light at the tip of the stylet was transilluminated and positioned at the center of the neck; subsequently, the tracheal tube was gently inserted at the location of light on the neck. (Fig. ). Face-to-face lightwand intubation was successful on the first attempt, and no specific complications, such as hemodynamic instabilities, intraoral traumas, or others, were encountered. After tracheal intubation, invasive arterial blood pressure was monitored through a cannula placed in the left radial artery using a hemodynamic monitoring device (EV1000 clinical platform, Edward Lifesciences Corp., Irwin, CA, USA). The surgery lasted approximately 7 h, during which vital signs were adequately maintained. After completion of surgery, neuromuscular blockade was reversed using sugammadex 200 mg followed by extubation in the operation room. Adequacy of respiration was confirmed, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit with continued monitoring. Although there was no postoperative sore throat or hoarseness of voice, there was suspicion of pulmonary congestion on chest radiography. On arterial blood gas analysis, the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) while breathing room air was 64 mmHg. However, the patient was not dyspneic, and pulmonary congestion and PaO2 improved over time. On postoperative day 2, the patient was transferred to the general ward without any significant problems.

His mother was on the first month of hospitalization at our institution for management of MDR-TB, a referral hospital for MDR-TB.\nOn examination, the child had respiratory distress with a pulse rate of 137 beats/min, respiratory rate of 22 cycles/min and temperature of 40.1 °C. His weight and height were 20 kg and 80 cm, respectively. There was pallor of the conjunctivae, palms and soles. The BCG scar was present on the left forearm. The heart was tachycardic with audible functional systolic murmurs. A bilateral consolidation syndrome was also noted on examination of the lungs. An initial diagnosis of pediatric pulmonary TB/HIV coinfection, associated with a clinical anaemia was made. MDR-TB was the principal differential diagnosis.\nA sputum analysis done was positive for acid-fast bacilli. Since he was a household contact of the mother and given that he became very ill, and unable to produce one more sputum, we chose to collect the gastric aspirate and sent for gene Xpert MTB/RIF and culture/DST in other to make a good diagnosis early enough. The gastric aspirate was positive for a Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rifampicin resistant strain using Xpert MTB/RIF assay. After performing the proportional method -drug susceptibility testing (PM-DST) on Lowenstein Jensen slopes, the child was found to have the same resistance pattern like the mother (Isoniazid-susceptible, Rifampicin-resistant, Ethambutol-susceptible, Kanamycine-susceptible, Ofloxacine-susceptible and streptomycine-not done). Due to the severe anaemia at 6.1 g/dl, he received 20 ml/kg (400 ml) of whole blood in emergency. The results of his pre-therapeutic work-up for MDR-TB regimen were as follows: slightly raised Aspartate Aminotransferase but normal Alanine Aminotransferase at 68 and 28.5 U/l, respectively; Serum Creatinine was normal at 0.45 mg/dl. An antero-posterior view chest X-ray revealed a bilateral micro-nodular interstitial opacity associated with bilateral hilar adenopathy (Fig. ). Also an audiogram and electrocardiogram (ECG) done were not contributive.\nAfter discussing the case with the MDR-TB consultant of the National Tuberculosis Program (NTP), with regards to the results of his pre-therapeutic work-up, the short 9 month—regimen was initiated according to his weight: 4 months of Amikacin/Moxifloxacin/Prothionamide/Isoniazid/Clofazimin/Ethambutol/Pyrazinamid for the initiation phase, followed with 5 months of Moxifloxacin/Clofazimin/Ethambutol/Pyrazinamid for the continuation phase [4(AmMfxPtoHCfzEZ)/5(MfxCfzEZ)]. His viral load was 23,144 copies/µl and the CD4 cell count 149cells/mm.\nDay 36 of hospitalization was marked by another episode of decompensated severe anaemia at 3.9 g/dl and non-infectious enteritis (with abdominal pains and watery stool). This prompted another transfusion of whole blood cells at 20 ml/kg (400 ml), and iron and folic acid syrup at a dose of 6 mg/kg/day (120 mg) were continued twice daily for a month. In addition, the patient presented with mild bilateral knee pain which was immediately controlled with 2 mg/kg (40 mg) dose of diclofenac divided twice a day. He also presented with a progressive brownish discoloration of the eyes with no visual impairment for which he is been followed-up. During the course of the treatment, the child was doing well and was able to produce a good sputum sample; he was discharged 4 months after the initiation phase with consecutively negative monthly sputum controls (Table ).

    "question": "A 53-year-old man (height, 170 cm; weight, 89 kg) was admitted to the hospital because of a 1-year history of shortness of breath after exercise. The patient was a smoker, had a history of hypertension, and was taking captopril and nimodipine. Breathing was reduced in the left lung. However, neither rhonchus nor moist rales were heard during auscultation. Chest computed tomography revealed a GEB, and the left lung was compressed by about 95% with a right mediastinal shift (). An electrocardiogram showed normal findings, and echocardiography revealed that the heart was located in the right thoracic cavity. The left ventricular diastolic function was decreased, and the left ventricular ejection fraction was 64%. Laboratory tests showed no obvious abnormalities. Arterial blood gas analysis showed the following: pH: 7.43, PaCO2: 41 mmHg, PaO2: 94 mmHg, lactate: 1.4 mmol/L, potassium: 3.6 mmol/L, sodium: 138 mmol/L, calcium: 1.10 mmol/L, FiO2: 21%, and SpO2: 98%.\nOn the day of surgery, the patient’s electrocardiogram, blood pressure, SpO2, and bispectral index were monitored upon entry into the operating room. A radial artery catheter and right internal jugular venous catheter were placed. The patient’s arterial blood pressure was 175/109 mmHg, heart rate was 90 beats/minute, and SpO2 was 94%. Before anesthesia, 40 µg of dexmedetomidine was infused within 10 minutes. The thoracic surgeon then created a small incision at the intersection of the sixth intercostal space and the left mid-axillary line to puncture the lung bulla and insert an indwelling catheter (14 Ga, 16 cm in length; Arrow International/Teleflex, Wayne, PA, USA) into the GEB to drain it for 15 minutes. The patient was preoxygenated with 100% oxygen at 6 L/minute for 5 minutes. Anesthesia was administered using 100 mg of propofol, 30 µg of sufentanil, and 50 mg of rocuronium. A 37-Fr right double-lumen endotracheal tube was inserted with the help of a visual laryngoscope, and single-lung ventilation was performed after proper alignment had been confirmed by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The tidal volume was set at 5 to 6 mL/kg, the respiratory rate was 15 to 17 breaths/minute, the positive end-expiratory pressure was set at 5 cmH2O, and the inhalation:expiration ratio was 1:2. Propofol, remifentanil, and sevoflurane were used to maintain anesthesia. The intraoperative bispectral index was maintained at 40 to 50. After resecting the GEB (), one-lung ventilation was switched to two-lung ventilation and the lungs slowly expanded with a low tidal volume until complete lung re-expansion was observed. During the 3-hour surgery, the patient experienced 50 mL of blood loss, was administered 1300 mL of lactated Ringer’s solution, and excreted 500 mL of urine. After the operation, the double-lumen endotracheal tube was replaced with a single-lumen endotracheal tube and the patient was sent to the intensive care unit for monitoring and further treatment. Two hours after entering the intensive care unit, the patient was fully awake and the tracheal tube was smoothly removed. The following day, the patient was transferred to the thoracic surgery ward, where he recovered; he was discharged 12 days later. Postoperative chest computed tomography showed that the lungs were well inflated with no abnormalities (). What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)? Your answer should be in terms of kg/m².",

She had no symptoms of fever, gross hematuria, foamy urine, photosensitivity, alopecia, oral ulcers, skin rash, joint pain, or urgency or pain in urination.\nHer physical examination on admission showed no remarkable findings other than the mild edema of the lower extremities. Her body weight was 50 kg, height was 159 cm, and blood pressure was 114/82 mm Hg. There were no palpable lymph nodes, and the chest and abdominal exams were normal.\nLaboratory tests showed hemoglobin, 129 g/L; white blood cells, 8.17 × 109/L; and platelets, 151 × 109/L. Urinalysis was positive for 4+ protein; RBC, 3/HP protein/creatinine ratio, 4.88 g/g Cr; and urine protein, 4.74 g/24 hour. Blood biochemistry analysis revealed albumin, 23.8 g/L; blood nitrogen urea, 5.60 mmol/L; serum creatinine, 50.0 μmol/L; uric acid, 208.0 μmol/L; and cholesterol, 6.24 mmol/L.\nANA was positive (1:1000); anti-dsDNA antibody was positive; anti-Sm antibody was negative; serum C3 was 0.6720 g/L (normal range 0.785–1.520 g/L); and C4 was 0.0806 g/L (normal range 0.145–0.360 g/L). There were negative findings for C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, anti-streptolysin O, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and anti-glomerular antibodies. Immunofixation electrophoresis did not reveal monoclonal immunoglobulin. Renal ultrasonography showed that the size of the right kidney was 10.5 × 4.5 × 4.2 cm3, while the left measured 11.5 × 5.0 × 4.9 cm3.\nA renal biopsy was performed, and light microscopy revealed that 35 glomeruli had thickening of the GBM (Fig. A) and subepithelial fuchsinophilic protein deposition (Fig. B). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed granular deposition of IgG and C3 along the glomerular capillary wall. The glomerular capillary was negative for PLA2R and THSD7A staining. An electron micrograph revealed subepithelial electron-dense deposits, thickening of the GBM, and foot process fusion (Fig. D).\nWe diagnosed the patient with membranous lupus nephritis (LN) (pure class V LN). We stained EXT1 by immunohistochemistry after the association of exostosin 1/exostosin 2 (EXT1/EXT2) and secondary MN was reported.[ The results showed positive staining for EXT1 along the glomerular capillary wall (Fig. C).\nThe patient was given prednisone at a dose of 40 mg per day, which was tapered down after 1 month, hydroxychloroquine, and aspirin. Four 200 mg doses of RTX were given with the frequency of doses dependent on CD19+ B-cells counts; the average interval between doses was 2 months (Fig. ).\nThe patient achieved complete remission 8 months after her hospital admittance.

    "question": "A 41-year-old Chinese woman was referred to the Department of Neurology, Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China, with the chief complaint of high spiking fever for approximately a month with bilateral lower limb fatigue and difficulty in defecation for more than five months. She had been residing in Yingde City of Guangdong Province for 10 years with no known prior exposure to any infectious or occupational diseases. In July 2010, she was diagnosed with 'whole body multiple metastases of lymphoma'. Due to economic reasons, the patient was transferred at the end of July 2010 to Donghua Hospital of Yingde City for treatment of her symptoms of infection, constipation, low potassium and leukopenia. By August 2010, the patient was unable to walk with bilateral lower limb fatigue and was subsequently admitted to the Department of Radiation Oncology at Nanfang Hospital.\nOn admission, the patient was 152 cm tall and weighed 52 kg. Her blood pressure was 112/82 mm Hg, temperature 38.5°C with a respiratory rate of 16 times per minute. No superficial enlarged lymph nodes were palpable. Inspiratory and expiratory sounds were normal to auscultation. There was no percussion tenderness over the liver or kidney. Muscle strength of upper limbs was normal and that of lower limbs was 3/5. Bilateral Babinski sign was positive. Sensation of pain and touch below the knees were slightly reduced. Physiological reflexes were slightly active. There was no pedal edema. All other physical tests were normal.\nLaboratory findings were as follows: total urinary protein, 5.61 g/dL (56.1 g/L); serum albumin, 2.89 g/dL (28.9 g/L); blood urea nitrogen, 2.24 mg/dL (1.6 mmol/L); and creatinine, 0.54 mg/dL (48 μmol/L). The urine protein and occult blood values were negative. Urinary leukocyte count was 48/μL (4.8 × 107/L); erythrocyte count, 3.78 × 106/μL (3.78T/L); hemoglobin, 9.9 g/dL (99 g/L); lymphocyte count, 1.12 × 103/μL (1.12 g/l) and platelet count, 1.73 × 105/μL (173 g/l).\nBone marrow aspiration was performed and the slide smear revealed 41.5% immature cells of unknown origin. Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET-CT) showed the following changes (Figure ). The bilateral renal parenchyma was markedly swollen with obvious diffuse increase in signal intensity. Increased signal intensity was observed in multiple thoracic vertebral bodies, multiple lumbar vertebral bodies, bilateral sacrum, ilium, proximal humerus and femur medullary cavities. Mildly increased signal intensity was observed in both lungs. The possibility of interstitial pneumonia was not excluded. Multiple bilateral neck and mediastinum lymph nodes were mildly enlarged with inflammatory proliferation. The spleen was markedly enlarged with mild diffuse increase in signal intensity. A large volume of pelvic effusion was detected.\nThe day after admission, a percutaneous renal biopsy was performed. Eleven glomeruli were present with no evidence of mesangial cell proliferation or capillary wall thickening. Island-like accumulations of medium to large lymphoid cells were observed in many areas of the interstitium, with round vesicular nuclei containing distinct basophilic nucleoli (Figure ). Immunohistochemical analysis showed the atypical lymphoid cells to be positive for B-cell markers CD20 (Figure ) and negative for CK, CD3, CD45RO and CD10. They were positive for large B-cell lymphoma marker mum-1 (Figure ). Immunohistochemical staining using anti-CD34 confirmed the accumulation of lymphoid cells to be localized within the peritubular capillary lumina (Figure ). Immunofluorescence revealed negative staining of IgG, IgA, IgM, C3 and C1q with no glomerular immune deposits. Electron microscopy did not detect any electron dense deposits, but did show a cluster of atypical lymphocytes encircled by a peritubular capillary wall.\nPathologic examinations of percutaneous renal biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma of Stage IVE. The patient returned to the local hospital for symptomatic treatment after diagnosis. Ten days later she was readmitted into Nanfang hospital due to sudden bilateral lower limb fatigue and inability to walk. She was treated with chemotherapy consisting of CHOP (cyclophosphamide 1.0 g D1+Doxorubicin 60 mg D1+leurocristime 2 mg D1+Prednisone 100 mg D1-5) for a week. Palliative radiotherapy DT 40Gy/20F and other supportive treatment were provided for metastatic foci in the medullary cavity of sternum, T1-7. The patient regained muscle strength in both lower limbs and was able to walk again. She was discharged after hepatic and renal function values had returned to normal. Follow-up data shows the patient to be alive, nine months after discharge. What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)? Your answer should be in terms of kg/m².",

    "question": "We described a male patient, born to a 38 years old mother at 30 weeks’ gestation by emergency Cesarean section, performed because of pre-eclampsia and IUGR associated with poly-hydramnios, detected by 26 weeks. The pregnancy was complicated by maternal type 2 DM, requiring subcutaneous insulin, Antenatal serologies (TORCH, HIV, Treponema and Hepatitis) were protective. Cytogenetic investigation of the fetus by villocentesis confirmed a normal 46,XY karyotype. Paternal medical history was unremarkable. Parents were non-consanguineous Caucasians.\nApgar scores were 6 at 1 minute and 7 at 5 minutes of life. Physical parameters were as follows: weight 1190 g (<10° centile), length 36 cm (<3° centile) and head circumference 26 cm (<10° centile). Physical examination was normal except for a moderate respiratory distress, During the first hours of life, the respiratory status worsened, evolving towards a third-degree hyaline-membrane disease that required surfactant administration, mechanical ventilation for a 24 hour period and non-invasive ventilation for 10 days.\nThroughout the first 3 days of life, the patient experienced a significant weight loss (as high as 19% of the birth weight), associated with polyuria (4.7-5.5 ml/kg/h) and hypernatremia (serum sodium 152–159 mEq/l), despite adequate fluid intake. At first, hypernatremia was interpreted as a consequence of the excessive weight loss and treated with large amounts of daily intravenous fluids (180–200 ml/kg/d). The clinical course was complicated by one episode of Serratia Marcescens septic shock during the second week of life and disseminated intravascular coagulation requiring plasma administration, platelet transfusion and aggressive antibiotic therapy.\nCDI was subsequently suspected as a result of persistent hypernatremia (serum sodium 150 mEq/L), high plasma osmolarity (322 mOsm/L) and low urine osmolarity (190 mOsm/l) with a Uosm/Posm ratio < 1 associated with failure to thrive during the first four weeks of life. The diagnosis of CDI was confirmed by the desmopressin test, showing a normal urine concentrating capability after nasal desmopressin (DDAVP) administration with rapid raise in urine osmolarity and reduced plasma osmolarity and the brain MRI at 34 weeks postmestrual age demonstrating the lack of posterior pituitary hyperintense signal. Bilateral asymmetrical optic nerve hypoplasia associated with right orbital bone hypoplasia was also observed, suggesting the diagnosis of WF []. No other abnormalities of the CNS were found.\nOphthalmologic examination revealed eyeball and right optic disc hypoplasia, associated with exotropia. Visual evoked potential confirmed the pathological findings of the right optic pathway, while the electroretinogram resulted normal. Audiological examinations were normal. Borderline TSH values with normal thyroid function were recorded during hospitalization, but no treatment was required until the end of the first year of life, when levo-thyroxine substitutive therapy was started because of primary non-autoimmune central hypothyroidism with a small thyroid gland. During the five years follow-up mild psychomotor and mental retardation were diagnosed. No glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus have been detected so far.\nAfter the catch-up growth, length and head circumference has stabilized around the 50° centile and, after the first year of life, body weight was above the 97° centile.\nWater and electrolyte balance is maintained with standard doses of nasal desmopressin.\nNo progression of the bilateral asymmetrical OA was noted at the 1-year follow-up MRI. However, new pathological signs (reduced corpus callosus, moderate ventricular dilatation, asymmetric hippocampus and altered occipital peri-ventricular white matter signal intensity) [] were noticed.\nGenetic investigation of the patient and his relatives revealed a segmental paternal heterodisomy of the chromosome 4 (segmental pat-hUPD4), involving at least part of the promoter and the first exon of WFS1 that we hypothesized could remove splicing regulatory motifs located in intron 1. Direct sequencing analysis of WFS1 cDNA showed a mixed sequencing pattern including the wild-type transcript sequence and two splice variants. The first splice variant was a previously described 4-bp deletion in exon 2, while the second one exhibited the complete skipping of exon 2 and, probably, the loss of the transcription start site. RT-PCR confirmed a normal mRNA expression compared to young controls, while Western blot analysis showed a significantly decreased Wolframin expression [].

    "question": "A 38-month-old boy was brought to the Seoul National University Children's Hospital due to a sudden onset of respiratory difficulty. The patient had no perinatal problems but began to develop intermittent alcoholic stool at 1 year of age. Beginning at 2 years of age, the patient suffered from frequent abdominal cramps. The patient presented with dyspnea and tachypnea but did not show signs of fever, cough, cyanosis, chest pain, vomiting, or abdominal pain.\nThe patient's height and weight were 95.6 cm (25–50th percentile) and 13.3 kg (10–25th percentile), respectively. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 123/72 mmHg; pulse rate, 152 beats/min; respiratory rate, 36 breaths/min; and body temperature, 36.9°C. The chest wall expanded symmetrically with chest retraction. Decreased breathing sound was heard in the left lung field.\nChest radiography and computed tomography (CT) showed massive left pleural effusion (). Percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) was conducted and pleural effusion was drained. Pleural fluid revealed elevated amylase levels of 25,460 U/L and lipase levels of >6,000 U/L. Serum results also revealed elevated amylase levels of 888 U/L and lipase levels of 1,067 U/L, which was suggestive of acute pancreatitis.\nAbdomen CT showed retroperitoneal fluid collection, diffuse pancreatic ductal dilatation, and atrophy in the pancreatic body and tail parenchyma, which was suggestive of CP. Although the abdomen CT did not reveal a definite PPF tract, the elevated amylase and lipase levels from the pleural fluid were suggestive of a fistula tract between the pancreas and pleura. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) revealed suspicious luminal narrowing of the pancreatic duct, with probable pancreatic duct stone and sludge. A tract near the left diaphragm is thought to be the fistula that connects to the pleural cavity ().\nThe patient was kept under fasting conditions with massive intravenous hydration, and octreotide continuous infusion and total parenteral nutrition were initiated. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed to further clarify the possible duct anomaly and subsequent treatment. The pancreatic duct was tortuous and dilated, and there was a filling defect due to the pancreaticolith (). A single pigtail plastic stent was inserted at the pancreatic duct and some white stones and protein plugs were removed. After symptoms improved, the PCD was removed and octreotide was tapered.\nThe pancreatic stent was removed spontaneously via defecation 8 days after stent insertion. After 3 days, a fever of up to 39.4°C developed and left pleural effusion increased. Serum amylase and lipase levels were elevated to 285 U/L and 527 U/L, respectively. Medical treatment, including fasting and octreotide continuous infusion, was restarted, and PCD insertion was conducted again. A second ERCP was done, and the stent was placed at the minor papilla through the major papilla. The pleural drain was removed after a week of post-stent insertion with no recurrence or effusion. The patient was discharged at hospital day 32. The stent was removed after 3 months. The patient is being followed-up regularly for exocrine dysfunction and recurrence of pancreatitis by monitoring fecal elastase, and serum amylase and lipase levels, respectively.\nThis patient had a family history of pancreatic diseases (). The patient's uncle underwent 80% distal pancreatectomy due to CP with multiple stones, and the grandfather had pancreatic cancer. The great-aunt and first cousin also had pancreatic diseases. The patient and his family underwent genetic tests, which revealed that the patient, mother, uncle, and grandfather were R122H heterozygotes for PRSS1 gene which encodes cationic trypsinogen.

    "question": "Our patient is a 4-year-old African-American boy born full-term via vaginal delivery, following an uneventful pregnancy, with a birth weight of 2722 grams (9th percentile). He required two weeks in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for neonatal abstinence syndrome and poor feeding. He was only breastfed a handful of times, and various formulas were tried without success. His difficulties with feeding persisted following discharge, and soon after birth, he developed chronic diarrhea. Throughout his first year of life, he also suffered from multiple respiratory tract infections. His motor development was appropriate while both social and language development were advanced; he was very talkative and interactive. He first presented at two years of age with rectal prolapse. Given his history and presentation, cystic fibrosis was considered (frequency of 1:15,000 in the African American population) [], but sweat chloride testing was negative. He went on to develop recurrent rectal prolapse, requiring a surgical reduction at three years old. The cause of the rectal prolapse was likely diarrhea and malnutrition, secondary to his underlying diagnosis [].\nAt three years of age, he was again admitted for emesis and weight loss in the setting of chronic diarrhea and worsening abdominal distention. It was reported that despite his persistent weight loss, he typically had a good appetite. His family denied both generalized protein aversion and episodes of severe illness following protein-rich meals. At the time of presentation, he weighed 13.2 kg (3.2 percentile) and was 93 cm (1.6 percentile) tall. His hair had gradually become straighter and lighter than was typical for him over the preceding year. He had significant hepatomegaly, with a liver span of 18 cm on ultrasound. Laboratory examinations demonstrated mild anemia, hypokalemia and hypoalbuminemia in the setting of transaminitis with a normal ammonia. Radiographs of his femurs and hands bilaterally, in addition to lumbosacral spine and pelvis, all demonstrated osteopenia. An echocardiogram showed mild left atrial enlargement, a small pericardial effusion and respiratory mitral inflow variability, all consistent with constrictive pathophysiology, thought to be secondary to his systemic processes. Congenital disorders of glycosylation were considered, however carbohydrate deficient transferrin levels were only slightly elevated, inconsistent with congenital disorders of glycosylation, though possible in cases of hereditary fructose intolerance. Urine amino acids were significant for elevated lysine and ornithine, though not to the extent expected in lysinuric protein intolerance. He was discharged with a working diagnosis of hereditary fructose intolerance, instructed to follow a fructose-free diet.\nThough he had initially improved on the fructose-free diet, after three days, his condition worsened. He developed food aversion and began spiking intermittent fevers. He was readmitted two weeks later with fever, decreased oral intake, weight loss, worsening abdominal distension and pain following an additional episode of rectal prolapse. The 60 most common CFTR mutations were tested at this time and were all negative. Plasma and urine amino acids were collected and the patient was started on empiric citrulline while awaiting results (, ).\nTargeted DNA Sequencing looking for SLC7A7 gene variants was ordered, and was negative for any pathogenic mutations. However, deletions, duplications and intronic variants will not be detected by this testing. LPI can be caused by deletion or duplication of SLC7A7 in approximately 15–20% of patients; however, a deletion/duplication assay could not be obtained []. Biopsies of the middle and distal esophagus, stomach, duodenum, terminal ileum and ascending and transverse colon were significant only for a focal increase in lamina propria eosinophils in the duodenum. Liver biopsy was significant for moderate to severe steatosis of the parenchyma, focal mild cholestasis, mild inflammatory infiltrate with scattered eosinophils and fibrosis. Both an upper GI series and contrast enema were completed but unrevealing.\nFollowing protein restriction and initiation of citrulline to correct for the intracellular defects of arginine and ornithine, carnitine was also started as levels were found to be low. On this regimen, our patient’s condition improved. His family reports he has had significantly more energy and his hair has begun to darken. Follow-up after 5 months showed a significant improvement regarding his nutritional status. His weight is 17.1 (45th percentile) but his height is still at 1st percentile.

    "question": "A 53-year old man (height, 175 cm; weight, 87 kg) was scheduled to undergo subtotal stomach-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy with portal vein reconstruction for pancreatic cancer after receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Laparoscopic left nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma was performed 1 year prior; therefore, harvesting the left internal jugular vein for portal vein reconstruction was planned because the left renal vein was too short. Preoperative serum creatinine level and potassium level were 1.39 mg/dL and 4.1 mEq/L, respectively.\nGeneral anesthesia was induced rapidly with propofol, rocuronium, fentanyl, and remifentanil and maintained with desflurane. The patient’s vital signs remained stable while resection of the distal stomach, gallbladder, distal common bile duct, and pancreatic head was performed. Bleeding from the first jejunal vein (J1V) occurred during adhesion detachment around the superior mesenteric vein (SMV), and clamping of the J1V was required to control the bleeding. Immediately after J1V clamping, bowel congestion progressed because the patient’s intestinal blood flow had been bypassed from the SMV to the inferior pancreaticoduodenal vein through J1V due to complete obstruction of the portal vein by the tumor. Therefore, a heparin-coated bypass tube (ANTHRON™ bypass tube, TORAY MEDICAL Co., Tokyo, Japan) was inserted from the SMV to the right great saphenous vein to relieve the bowel congestion. Several minutes after insertion of the ANTHRON™ bypass tube, blood potassium level rose from 4.7 mEq/L to 6.0 mEq/L, and pulseless ventricular tachycardia occurred. Chest compression was promptly performed by surgeons, and anesthesiologists attempted direct current defibrillation several times; epinephrine, magnesium sulphate, bicarbonate, lidocaine, and amiodarone were also administered. In addition to resuscitation, anesthesiologists inserted a blood-access catheter to the right internal jugular vein and started continuous renal replacement therapy to prevent elevation of blood potassium level. Spontaneous circulation was recovered after 30 min. The surgical team decided to discontinue the surgery, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) after packing gauze into the abdomen and with the ANTHRON™ bypass tube left inserted. Total blood loss was 5620 mL, and total fluid balance was + 6115 mL. The operation time was 10 h 30 min.\nTwo days after the first operation, the patient was scheduled to undergo tumor resection and portal vein reconstruction with REIV. The surgical team abandoned using the left internal jugular vein for portal vein reconstruction because of concerns that brain congestion after harvesting the jugular vein could affect brain function recovery. Anesthesia was maintained with dexmedetomidine, fentanyl, rocuronium, and remifentanil. Continuous hemodiafiltration had been performed in the ICU due to persistent anuria and continued during the operation to prevent hyperkalemia. Both legs were compressed with a pneumatic compression device throughout the operation to prevent deep venous thrombosis formation. A section of the REIV 5 cm in length was harvested intraperitoneally with a surgical stapler, and the REIV distal end was closed with a 4-0 polypropylene running suture. The inferior epigastric vein, pubic branch of the obturator vein, and the deep circumflex iliac vein were preserved. A surgical nurse noticed swelling of the patient’s right leg 2 h after harvesting; the surgical team ensured careful observation throughout the surgery because a transient change by congestion of the right leg was suspected. Blood potassium level was slightly elevated after REIV resection, but ventricular arrhythmia was absent. Surgery was completed as scheduled (operation time, 7 h 3 min), and the patient was transferred to the ICU again. Total blood loss and total fluid balance were 2485 mL and + 2587 mL, respectively.\nOn ICU admission, distention and fullness of the right leg worsened. An orthopedist diagnosed the patient with acute compartment syndrome, and right leg elevation to lower the intracompartmental pressure was initiated. Blood potassium level was rapidly elevated immediately after leg elevation (Fig. ), which caused sustained ventricular tachycardia despite efforts to lower blood potassium level such as the administration of bicarbonate, glucose-insulin, and continuous hemodialysis with potassium-free dialysate. Chest compressions were initiated immediately. Ventricular tachycardia was prolonged; therefore, veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO) was induced, and spontaneous circulation was recovered after resolution of hyperkalemia (Fig. , Table ). Emergent fasciotomy was performed by orthopedists 1 h after induction of V-A ECMO because the intracompartmental tissue pressure of the anterior compartment was 70 mmHg.\nV-A ECMO was withdrawn 2 days later, and the patient was extubated 10 days after portal vein reconstruction. He had no apparent neural deficits; however, paralysis and paresthesia of the right leg persisted after discharge from the ICU 17 days post-operatively. What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)? Your answer should be in terms of kg/m².",

    "question": "This patient was a 35-year-old Hispanic female with no past medical history who presented to the emergency department primarily for evaluation of heavy vaginal bleeding, bruises on her skin, and fatigue. Vaginal bleeding had started three days prior to presenting to the hospital. The patient had initially thought that she may be pregnant because the onset of her cycle was late by approximately 15 days. The bleeding improved prior to presenting to the hospital but was still much heavier than her usual periods. At the time of heaviest bleeding, the patient reported changing pads every few hours and occasionally passing clots the size of a quarter. Associated symptoms included fatigue, weakness/malaise, abdominal pain, dizziness, and easy bruising. Review of systems was otherwise negative.\nFurther evaluation revealed that she did not have any bleeding disorders, abortions, or previously late/missed periods in the past. As for obstetric history, the patient had two prior pregnancies that had both gone to full term with vaginal delivery. Family history was also unremarkable for any hereditary bleeding disorders, cancers, or other pertinent medical diagnoses. The patient was not taking any medications at time of hospitalization. Surgical history was unremarkable. Regarding social history, she reported cigarette smoking in the past but had quit for several years, occasional alcohol use, and no current or past illicit drug use. Lastly, the patient had been isolating at home with her partner and their two children.\nPhysical examination at time of presentation revealed the following vital signs: temperature 36.5 Celsius, pulse of 60, respiratory rate 16, pulse oximetry 100% on ambient air, and blood pressure of 110/66. She remained afebrile and never required supplemental oxygen. In general, the patient appeared tired but was not lethargic or somnolent.

    "question": "A 48-year-old white male presented to the clozapine clinic for routine follow-up and monitoring. The past medical history was significant for schizoaffective disorder; tobacco use disorder; constipation; vitamin D deficiency; and metabolic syndrome characterized by obesity, dyslipidemia, and prediabetes. Current medications included clozapine 150 mg by mouth at bedtime, aspirin 81 mg by mouth daily, docusate 100 mg by mouth twice daily, and cholecalciferol 2000 units by mouth daily. He tried and failed multiple antipsychotics prior to initiation of clozapine 4 years ago. His mental health had been stable since initiating clozapine, and he resides in a group home. He gained 9.5 kg the year after clozapine was initiated, and then weight stabilized. He had difficulty controlling his diet at the group home and ate what was prepared for him. Despite lifestyle education, he continued to visit the vending machine frequently for soda (2 cans per day), candy bars (1 per day), and chips (1 bag per day). He was referred to a dietitian but was unable to successfully implement dietary changes. He did not have access to exercise equipment at his group home and did not walk outside due to inclement weather. He was referred to an exercise program located in the same facility as the clozapine clinic but did not attend the appointments. Metformin initiation for weight management and prediabetes was recommended at several appointments, but he declined because he preferred not to take more medications. He smoked half a pack of cigarettes per day and was not interested in smoking cessation services.\nHis resting BP was elevated at his past 2 appointments (136/84 and 136/86 mm Hg), so the nurse at his group home had been recording daily BP readings in a log. His BP log revealed an average BP of 138/86 mm Hg. Pertinent vital signs and fasting laboratory results from the appointment were as follows: height: 5 feet, 10 inches; weight: 104.5 kg; BMI: 33 kg/m2; BP: 138/88 mm Hg; pulse: 79 bpm; hemoglobin A1c = 6%; TC = 225 mg/dL; LDL = 136 mg/dL; triglycerides = 395 mg/dL; HDL = 27 mg/dL; clozapine level = 132 mcg/L; norclozapine level = 135 mcg/L; white blood cell count = 8.4 thousand cells/mcl; and absolute neutrophil count = 5.1 thousand cells/mcl.\nClozapine is considered high risk for causing increases in weight, lipids, BG, and BP. This patient had already tried and failed multiple antipsychotics, and his mental health had been stable for 4 years on clozapine. Switching to an antipsychotic with lower liability for metabolic AEs is likely not a feasible option for this patient. Lifestyle interventions are a first-line treatment approach, but the patient had been unsuccessful with altering his diet, exercising, or attempting smoking cessation. Therefore, medically treating the metabolic AEs was necessary.\nHydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are considered the cornerstone of treatment for lipid lowering due to evidence demonstrating they can prevent ASCVD. There are 4 categories of patients that may benefit from statin therapy, including those with clinical ASCVD, LDL ≥190 mg/dL, diabetes aged 40 to 75 years, and estimated 10-year ASCVD risk score ≥7.5%. An online ASCVD risk estimator can be located at . Individuals with an ASCVD risk score of 7.5% to <20% are considered intermediate risk for a cardiovascular event, and a moderate-intensity statin can be initiated if risk enhancers favor it. Examples of risk-enhancing factors include but are not limited to metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, inflammatory disease (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, HIV), ethnicity (eg, South Asian ancestry), and persistently elevated triglycerides (≥175 mg/dL). Individuals with an ASCVD risk score ≥20% are considered high risk, and statin initiation should be considered with a goal to reduce LDL by at least 50%. Moderate-intensity statins are expected to lower the LDL by 30% to 49% and high-intensity statins by ≥50% ().\nStatins are most effective for lowering LDL, but they can also lower triglycerides (22% to 45%) and increase HDL (5% to 10%). Fibrates and niacin are effective for reducing triglycerides but have a mild LDL-lowering effect, and there is not enough evidence to routinely support their use as add-on medications to a statin. Adding a fibrate or omega-3 fatty acids to a statin is recommended for patients with persistently elevated severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥500 mg/dL) to prevent pancreatitis. Fenofibrate is preferred over gemfibrozil in patients being treated with a statin due to lower risk of myopathy. The dose of the statin is another important consideration. The largest percentage of LDL lowering is achieved with the initial dose., Each doubling of the statin dose should then lead to an additional 4% to 7% reduction in LDL., Clinical experience indicates that starting statins at a low dose and titrating up does not lead to the same level of LDL lowering as starting at a moderate- to high-intensity dose. Initiation of a lower intensity statin may be considered if there is a history of statin intolerance.\nStage 1 hypertension is defined as systolic BP 130 to 139 or diastolic BP 80 to 89 mm Hg. Stage 2 hypertension is defined as BP ≥140/90 mm Hg. At least 2 resting BP readings obtained on 2 separate occasions should be used to estimate the BP. A log of home BP readings can provide a more accurate estimation of BP if proper techniques are used. For primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults, nonpharmacologic therapy and treatment with an antihypertensive is recommended for individuals with stage 2 hypertension or stage 1 hypertension and a 10-year ASCVD risk of 10% or higher. Initiation of 2 antihypertensive agents from different classes is recommended for individuals with stage 2 hypertension. A BP target of <130/80 mm Hg is recommended. Thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are first-line treatments for hypertension due to evidence demonstrating that they reduce clinical events. There is inadequate evidence to support beta blockers as a first-line treatment for hypertension in the absence of certain cardiovascular comorbidities, such as heart failure or ischemic heart disease. Patient-specific factors, such as comorbidities, concurrent medications, age, race, and medication adherence, should be taken into consideration when selecting an initial antihypertensive.\nThe optimal treatment for hypertension in individuals with metabolic syndrome has not been clearly defined. Thiazide diuretics can increase insulin resistance and accelerate conversion to diabetes mellitus.,, They can also worsen dyslipidemia., The European Society of Cardiology and the European Society of Hypertension guidelines list metabolic syndrome as a possible contraindication for use of thiazide diuretics. The ACC/AHA guidelines note that small increases in BG levels are possible but also state there are no data available demonstrating deterioration in cardiovascular outcomes in patients with metabolic syndrome who are treated with thiazide diuretics. When no compelling indications or contraindications are present to help guide treatment selection, preference may be given to an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or CCB in patients with metabolic syndrome to help avoid increases in BG. Age and race can also help with treatment selection. Thiazide diuretics and CCBs are preferred in Black adults without heart failure or chronic kidney disease because they are more effective than ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Older adults may also respond better to thiazide diuretics and CCBs due to a declining number of nephrons and lower plasma renin levels.\nUsing an average BP of 138/86 mm Hg, the patient in this case had a 10-year ASCVD risk score of approximately 17.5%, placing him into a statin benefit group. His known risk-enhancing factors included metabolic syndrome, characterized by persistently elevated triglycerides, obesity, and elevated BP. He also smoked cigarettes. Lifestyle modifications continued to be encouraged, and a risk-benefit discussion about statin therapy was conducted. He was willing to initiate a statin and was started on atorvastatin 20 mg by mouth daily. A moderate-intensity statin was appropriate based on his 10-year ASCVD risk score. His triglycerides were elevated but not enough to warrant addition of a nonstatin therapy. His BP readings in the clinic and at home indicated he had stage 1 hypertension, and his 10-year ASCVD risk score was greater than 10%. The patient did not have any compelling indications or contraindications to help guide selection of an antihypertensive. Given his age, race, and history of metabolic syndrome, initiation of an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or CCB may be most appropriate. After review of the potential AEs associated with each medication class, the patient elected to start amlodipine 5 mg by mouth daily.

    "question": "A 44-year-old gravida 6 para 4 postpartum woman presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of substernal chest pain. That afternoon, she experienced sudden-onset severe left-sided chest pain radiating to her back and shoulder. She had been discharged four days prior after induction of labor for chronic hypertension with an uncomplicated vaginal birth. Her medical history was notable only for hypertension, for which she took metoprolol. She was maintained on metoprolol with good blood pressure control for the duration of her pregnancy and after induction. The day prior to admission she was under significant emotional distress after her infant was hospitalized with hyperbilirubinemia.\nIn the ED, the patient was afebrile, her blood pressure was 164/101 mm Hg, her heart rate was 60 beats per minute, and she was breathing 16 breaths per minute. Her cardiovascular examination was unremarkable with normal heart sounds with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops and no jugular venous distension. Her lungs were clear, her abdomen was soft, and she had no extremity edema. Her complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel results were within normal limits. Her initial troponin I was 0.41 ng/mL (reference range, <0.04 ng/mL), and her electrocardiogram (ECG) () was significant for ST elevation in leads V2-V5 consistent with an anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Her chest X-ray showed normal mediastinum, no signs of cardiomegaly, and clear lungs.\nGiven the concern for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the patient was emergently taken to the cardiac catheterization lab. Her coronary angiogram showed haziness of the midleft anterior descending (LAD) artery followed by an abrupt change in arterial caliber extending to the distal LAD and diagonal branches (). There was no clear visualization of a dissection flap, but there was a visible long segment of diffuse vessel narrowing in the mid to distal LAD highly suspicious for coronary dissection. Contrast flow in the distal vessel was normal (TIMI 3), and there were no luminal changes with the administration of intracoronary nitroglycerin. There was no angiographic evidence of atherosclerotic disease in any of her coronary arteries, and no evidence of narrowing in the coronary arteries outside of the LAD. Her chest pain was resolved during the procedure, and her ECG showed normalization of her ST elevation. Given the patient's hemodynamic stability, normal blood flow in the distal LAD, resolution of chest pain, and suspicion for dissection, she was managed conservatively.\nShe was started on IV nitroglycerin for hypertension, metoprolol, and dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel and then transferred to the coronary care unit for close observation. Her transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 68% and hypokinetic septal and apical walls in the distribution of the LAD. Her repeat ECG () showed the expected evolution of her STEMI with QS waves and T-wave inversions seen in leads V2-V5. She was weaned off the nitroglycerin and transitioned to captopril and nifedipine for strict blood pressure control and safety with breastfeeding.\nShe remained chest-pain free during the course of the hospitalization and underwent a repeat angiogram to evaluate for the progression of disease given the diagnostic uncertainty. Her repeat angiogram on day 6 of hospitalization showed complete resolution of the LAD lesion () consistent with dissection. Compared to the initial angiogram, the area of haziness was no longer present, and the vessel tapered appropriately towards the apical LAD. However, a new tubular narrowing with abrupt vessel caliber change () was noted in the midposterior descending artery (PDA), compared to her initial angiogram () with normal flow and no clear dissection flap. This event was concerning for a new dissection event. The patient was asymptomatic throughout her hospitalization and was discharged home with close obstetric, primary care, and cardiology outpatient follow-up.

    "question": "A 42-year-old male was hospitalized in July 2008 with dizziness and mild dyspnea lasting two months. He also complained of intermittent febrile sensations and night sweats. His medical history revealed three open heart surgeries before admission. The patient underwent open mitral commisurotomy with mitral valve stenosis in 1986. After five years, he underwent mitral valve replacement with a Carbomedics prosthetic valve (CarboMedics, Inc.; Austin, TX, USA) in 1991. In 2005, his tricuspid valve was also replaced with a St. Jude Medical prosthesis (St. Jude Medical Inc.; Minneapolis, MN, USA) due to severe tricuspid regurgitation. He also had a history of atrial fibrillation and cardiac liver cirrhosis. The patient was a stock farmer and had buried cattle afflicted by brucellosis one year before this admission.\nUpon admission, his vital signs showed a blood pressure of 130/70 mm Hg, pulse rate of 106 beats/min, respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min and body temperature of 37.5℃. Irregular heartbeats without murmurs were heard on auscultation and his electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response rate of 112 beats per minute. Laboratory studies revealed anemia and leukopenia with a hemoglobin level of 6.9 g/dL, a total white cell count of 2600/mm3 (66% neutrophils, 22% lymphocytes, 11% monocytes) and a platelet count of 191000/mm3. The C-reactive protein level of 5.76 mg/dL was elevated. The peripheral blood smears showed normocytic hypochromic erythrocytes with some fragmented cells.\nTransesophageal echocardiography (TEE) demonstrated a very small echogenic mass (3×8 mm) attached to the inferomedial portion of the prosthetic mitral valve annulus (; ) which was not seen on the last TEE. The function of the prosthetic mitral valve and tricuspid prosthetic valve was normal. Under suspicion of infective endocarditis, six blood cultures were drawn for the first 48 hours and inoculated into an automated system (BACTEC; Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD, USA). Because gram-negative coccobacilli were isolated from the initial blood culture after two days of incubation, an empirical antibiotic regimen of ceftriaxone (2 g/day) and gentamicin 3 mg/kg/day was started. The serum (tube) agglutination test against Brucella species showed a positive titer of 1:1280. The isolates of the automated hemoculture system were identified as Brucella species after six days and further identification of Brucella strains revealed B. abortus.\nA diagnosis of BE on the prosthetic mitral valve was considered in this patient and specific antibiotics were started. The patient was given a triple combination therapy consisting of oral doxycycline 100 mg twice a day, oral rifampin 600 mg once daily and an intramuscular injection of streptomycin 1000 mg once daily. After 12 days of treatment, his fever recurred and streptomycin was switched to intravenous gentamycin (5 mg/kg/day). Although surgery was initially planned, the patient refused reoperation at that time. Therefore, he was treated with antibiotics alone under close follow-up. After 12 days of treatment, the blood cultures were negative. Three weeks after treatment, the follow-up echocardiography demonstrated no vegetations in the prosthetic mitral valve (). After seven weeks of hospitalization, he was discharged with oral doxycycline 200 mg/day. Doxycycline was maintained for one year and his Brucella titers decreased to <1:160. The patient has been regularly followed in the outpatient clinic. At present, five years after discharge, the patient remains free of symptoms.

He had history of similar complaints in the past in the form of frequent episodes of cough with expectoration for which he was hospitalized and treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics. He had no history of dyspnea, chest pain or pedal edema. General physical examination was unremarkable except for grade I clubbing. Clinical examination revealed blood pressure of 118/84 mm Hg in right upper limb in supine position with pulse rate of 96/min, regular, normal volume with a normal character with no radio-radial or radio-femoral delay and all peripheral pulses equally palpable. The jugular venous pressure was raised 2 cm above the angle of Louis with a prominent c-v pattern. The apical impulse was in the fifth intercostals space medial to the midclavicular line. The S1 was normal, and S2 was narrowly split with loud P2 component. There was pan-systolic murmur along the left lower sternal border radiating all over the precordium. On systemic examination, respiratory system showed barrel-shaped chest with anteroposterior and transverse diameter ratio of 1, widely spaced ribs and increased resonance to percussion, and breath sounds decreased in intensity symmetrically with prolonged expiration. Rest of the examination was normal. On investigations, total leukocytes were 14,200/mm3, polymorphs 72%, lymphocytes 22%, monocytes 4%, eosinophils 2%, hemoglobin 15.1 g%, platelets 211,000/mm3, ESR 14 mm first h and fasting blood sugar was 98 mg%. Blood culture was negative for any growth. Sputum culture showed streptococcus pneumonia sensitive to amoxicillin, and patient was treated accordingly. On chest radiography, there were bronchiectatic changes. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with heart rate of 102 and right axis deviation. In lead II, III and aVF, P-wave was tall and peaked with maximum P-wave amplitude > 7 mm and larger than QRS complex in lead II (). P-wave axis was +82°. This was referred as Himalayan P-waves suggestive of right atrial enlargement. Precordial leads showed slow R-wave progression with right ventricular strain pattern (). The 2D transthoracic echocardiography revealed enlarged right atrium and right ventricle with severe tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary arterial hypertension and preserved ejection fraction. So these findings were consistent with sequelae of COPD. The findings of bronchiectasis were confirmed on HRCT chest as evident by cystic bronchiectasis with bronchial wall thickening and mucous plugging ().

Her serum total protein was 58.4 g/L (normal range: 65–85 g/L), albumin was 35.3 to 29.7 g/L, and serum creatinine was 0.87 mg/dl to 1.03 mg/dl with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 64.33 to 63.39 ml/min/1.73m2. Her white blood cell (WBC) was 6.10 × 109 cells/L (normal range: 3.5–9.5 × 109 cells/L), hemoglobin was 101 g/L (normal range: 115–150 g/L) and platelet was 196 × 109 cells/L (normal range: 125–300 × 109 cells/L). Serum anti-HCV antibody was still positive and serum HCV-RNA was undetectable. Serum cryoglobulin was negative. She was negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti- human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Treponema pallidum antibody (TP-Ab). Other laboratory data revealed serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G was 5.42 g/L (normal range: 7.23–16.85 g/L), IgA was 1.37 g/L (normal range: 0.69–3.82 g/L), and IgM was 0.60 g/L (normal range: 0.63–2.77 g/L). Serum C3 level was 0.674 g/L (normal range: 0.60–1.50 g/L), and C4 level was 0.154 g/L (normal range: 0.12–0.36 g/L). Serum and urine immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) did not identify monoclonal immunoglobulins. Anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and anti- phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) antibodies were all negative. Echocardiography and abdominal ultrasound were normal.\nThe patient underwent the first renal biopsy on February 26th, 2018. Direct immunofluorescence (IF) examination of frozen renal tissue revealed IgG +++, IgM +, C3 +++, C1q trace, C4d +++, κ++, λ++++, IgG1 +, IgG2 ++, IgG3 +++, IgG4 +, which were deposited along the capillary wall and mesangial area of the glomeruli (Fig. a-f). Light microscopic examination showed that 10/47 glomeruli were globally sclerosed. Other glomeruli showed a MPGN pattern with severe mesangial cell and matrix proliferation with nodular lesions, thickening of the capillary wall and double contour formation (Fig. g). Congo red staining for amyloid was negative. Electron microscopic examination revealed electron-dense deposits in the mesangial, subendothelial and subepithelial area. Subendothelial edema was observed in segmental capillary loops (Fig. h). Hence the pathological diagnosis was immune-complex mediated MPGN due to polyclonal immunoglobulins deposition.\nTo explore the etiology and pathogenesis of MPGN, the differential diagnosis and further examinations were performed. Autoimmune diseases were excluded as the absence of antoantibodies and relevant clinical manifestations. The anti-HCV antibodies were positive in the serum, but the serum HCV-RNA was negative, as were the serum cryoglobulin, serum C3 and C4 and HCV antigen staining on the renal tissue, excluding the diagnosis of HCV related MPGN. Other chronic infections were not identified. According to the IF findings by dominant IgG3 and λ light chain, monoclonal gammopathy associated MPGN was suspected. Bone marrow aspiration smear revealed 1.5% plasma cells. Bone marrow biopsy showed a few plasma cells with normal change. CD38 positive cells accounted for 0.28% of bone marrow cells, but no evidence of monoclonal light chain restricted expression as determined by flow cytometry and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). She was treated with olmesartan 40 mg/d, ramipril 10 mg/d, amlodipine 10 mg/d and metoprolol 25 mg/d, blood pressure was controlled around 120/70 mmHg. She did not receive any anti-HCV treatment.\nSix months after renal biopsy, her proteinuria increased to 5.57 g/d, with serum albumin 31.8 g/L, serum creatinine 1.29 mg/dl. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil and tripterygium wilfordii were prescribed. One month later, her proteinuria decreased to 2.47 g/d with a serum albumin 27.7 g/L, serum creatinine 0.97 mg/dl. However, her serum creatinine increased to 1.96 mg/dl, and a repeated renal biopsy was performed 9 months later in November 19th, 2018.\nIF examination of frozen renal tissue revealed IgG ++++, C3 +++, C1q negative, C4d +++ (immunohistochemistry), κ trace, λ++++, IgG1 negative, IgG2 negative, IgG3 +++,IgG4 negative, which were deposited along the capillary wall and mesangial area of the glomeruli (Fig. a-f). Light microscopic examination showed that 2/20 glomeruli were globally sclerosed. Other glomeruli showed a MPGN pattern(Fig. g). More prominent tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis than the first time, with focal loss of brush border of the tubular epithelial cells. There was moderate interstitial infiltration of lymphocytes, monocytes and a few eosinophils. Electron microscopic examination revealed electron-dense deposits in the mesangial, subendothelial and subepithelial area. (Fig. h). The patient was diagnosed with proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal IgG3λ deposition (PGNMID). Further testes showed serum free κ chain was 16.8 mg/L (normal range: 3.30–19.40 mg/L), free λ chain was 25.3 mg/L (normal range: 5.71–26.3 mg/L), and the κ/λ ratio was 0.664 (normal range: 0.26–1.65). Serum and urine IFE were still negative for monoclonal immunoglobulin. Repeated serum anti-HCV antibody detection was negative without anti-HCV treatment.\nTherapy and follw-up: The patient was treated with prednisone (40 mg/d) and cyclophosphamide (100 mg/d), her serum creatinine decreased to 1.47 mg/dl and remained stable until March 2019. Then she suffer an episode of herpes zoster, cyclophosphamide was discontinued, and the patient’s serum creatinine increased to 2.54 mg/dl.

He had associated nonproductive cough for one week but denied any calf pain, leg swelling, hemoptysis, recent travel, recent surgeries, fever, or chills. His past medical history was notable for hypertension that was well controlled on lisinopril. He was also prescribed with 50 mg of clomiphene citrate 2 years ago due to low testosterone. He did not take any other medications and denied any smoking history. He denied any family history of blood clots or bleeding disorders.\nOn physical examination, his temperature was 97.8 F, respiratory rate was 26 breaths/min, blood pressure was 109/58 mm Hg, heart rate was 134 beats/min, and SpO2 was 96% on 6 liters nasal cannula. He had normal heart sounds without any murmurs and rubs and had clear lungs. He had trace pedal edema bilaterally without any calf tenderness. Laboratory results include leukocytes of 15.4 × 109/L, hemoglobin of 15.8 g/dL, platelets of 207 × 109/L, creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL, and troponin I <0.05 ng/ml initially, but later plateaued at 0.10 ng/ml.\nElectrocardiogram on admission showed sinus tachycardia and incomplete right bundle branch block with S1Q3T3 pattern. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of chest revealed acute large volume pulmonary embolism in bilateral main pulmonary arteries, lobar, and segmental branches of all lobes with mild right heart strain (as shown in ). Venous Doppler showed acute deep vein thrombosis in the right lower extremity involving the popliteal and posterior tibial veins. Echocardiogram was done which revealed a systolic ejection fraction of 55–65% with mildly decreased right ventricular systolic function.\nThe patient was started on a high flow nasal cannula initially for respiratory distress and then eventually was weaned to room air. He was started on heparin drip for anticoagulation that was later switched to rivaroxaban. Since clomiphene citrate (CC) was thought to be a contributing factor for pulmonary embolism, it was stopped, and he was referred to follow-up with a hematologist to evaluate for prothrombotic risk. His further workup for hypercoagulable disorders including anticardiolipin antibodies, factor V Leiden mutation and prothrombin gene mutation has been negative.

    "question": "A 39-year-old female patient, who had black stool twice without obvious inducement 3 days ago, accompanied by dizziness, and no other symptoms such as abdominal distension, abdominal pain, cold, and fever. After symptomatic treatment in the local hospital, the condition did not improve, so came to our hospital for further treatment and was hospitalized with gastrointestinal bleeding. Physical examination: T 36.7 °C, P 78/min, R 20/min, BP 99/62 mmHg, moderate anemia (Hb 85 g/L), no other abnormal signs and previous history of other diseases. After admission, through the preliminary examination of abdominal CT scanning, the results showed that hepatic cysts, small calcifications in the left lobe of the liver, and gallbladder inflammation, but no abnormalities in the intestinal tract. Subsequently, through electronic gastroscopy and enteroscopy, the results of the gastroscopy showed that patchy erythema could be seen in the gastric antrum, while in other parts of the stomach, the mucosa was smooth, the folds were intact, and the gastric peristalsis was good, which was diagnosed as superficial gastritis. The enteroscopy showed that, when the electronic enteroscope was inserted into the end of the ileum, a small amount of brown liquid could be seen, the intestinal mucosa was smooth, and the ileocecal valve is good. While a lot of coffee-like liquid could be seen in the colon cavity, but no bleeding site was found. At this time, we discussed and evaluated the relevant research results and case data, and highly suspected the possibility of intestinal vascular disease. In order to make a clear diagnosis and locate the bleeding site, further capsule endoscopy was performed (the whole photography time of capsule endoscopy was 11 h and 30 min). After the capsule endoscopy was swallowed, it was sent to the duodenum under the gastroscope, and entered the colon in 3 h and 27 min. Fortunately, some gains were obtained, at 48 min, there were a lot of fluid and blood clots in the upper and middle segment of the jejunum could be seen, but the entire field of vision was poorly blurred and no bleeding point was still found (). Through the results of capsule endoscopy, we were full of confidence in the previous judgment, and initially positioned the bleeding site in the jejunum.\nAfter a week of treatment through nutritional support, rehydration and correction of anemia, the patient still had recurrent and intermittent black stool, and her condition was not very stable. Therefore, we decided to explore by laparotomy []. Based on the results of capsule endoscopy, the dark black part of the jejunum was found, and then the jejunum was cut at about 5 cm above it for intraoperative enteroscopy. The bleeding spot was finally found (located at about 10 cm from jejunum to the ligament of Traitz) and then the hemostasis was stopped by suture. Finally, it was diagnosed as jejunal telangiectasia complicated with bleeding (). After hemostasis during the operation, a thorough and careful exploration of other intestines was performed, and no other bleeding sites were found. After operation, the patient's condition was stable and the symptoms of hematochezia and anemia were controlled through symptomatic treatment.

They brought him to Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center emergency room. His initial vital signs showed a temperature of 100 ºF, blood pressure of 143/91 mmHg, heart rate of 105 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 per minute. He was noticed to have disseminated, vesicular-pustular rash all over his body at different stages of healing and crusted skin eruption on his anterior neck and submandibular area (Figures -).\nPatient’s neurological exam revealed that he was alert and oriented to self only, had a right-sided upper and lower facial droop. The patient also had impaired hearing on the right side. The muscle strength was 5/5 throughout. The patient had normal reflexes and the sensation was intact. The remainder of his physical exam did not show any other abnormal findings. Computerized tomography of the head without contrast showed no acute intracranial pathology. Subsequently, the patient had a lumbar puncture done in the emergency room which revealed a cloudy cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with a white blood cell count of 849 cells/uL with lymphocyte predominance (72%), glucose of 39 mg/dl and protein of 364 mg/dl. Serum electrolytes, liver enzymes, and coagulation profile were all within normal limits. CSF sample was sent for a varicella-zoster polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test as well. His chest X-ray was clear without any infiltrates. His initial laboratory investigations are summarized in Table .\nA presumptive diagnosis of disseminated VZV with encephalitis was made according to the patient's skin lesions and CSF analysis. Therefore, he was started on intravenous acyclovir at 10 mg/kg every eight hours and admitted to the general medical floor under contact and airborne precautions. Patient’s varicella zoster PCR from the CSF sample came back positive. Patient mental status improved rapidly within 48 hours of treatment and he became alert and fully oriented. On eye exam, the patient had diplopia with right gaze, and it was determined that he had a right sixth cranial nerve palsy. He had deficits in right sided cranial nerves VI, VII, and VIII evident by impaired right eye abduction, right sided facial weakness, as well as impaired hearing. This constellation of findings is likely secondary to Ramsay Hunt syndrome with multiple cranial nerve involvement. Intravenous acyclovir was continued, and the patient started taking prednisone 50 mg orally for five days for the treatment of Ramsay Hunt syndrome. He was also found to have otitis externa and was prescribed ciprofloxacin with dexamethasone otic drops. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain without contrast found nonspecific white matter lesions in the high left frontal lobe measuring approximately 8 mm but otherwise no mass, hemorrhage, or acute infarct (Figure ).\nThe patient’s mental status came back to his baseline on day three. The patient’s rash had crusted on day six hence the isolation precautions were discontinued. He started ambulating without any difficulty and facial paralysis resolved by day eight. He was safely discharged home after nine days of hospital stay with oral acyclovir 400 mg tablets three times daily for 21 days and prednisone 50 mg tablets daily for three days.

    "question": "A 45-year-old man, who was diagnosed with gastric SET detected on endoscopy during a routine medical examination, was referred to our hospital in August 2016 for further evaluation. He was symptom-free and presented no specific abdominal symptoms such as pain, vomiting, heartburn, dysphagia, or change in bowel habits. He had no history of medication or family history of malignant disease or autoimmune disorder.\nIn the physical examination, his blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg and heart rate was 80 bpm. The abdomen was soft and flat, and no palpable mass was observed. His laboratory results were normal for the following parameters: leucocyte count, 8900/mm3; hemoglobin level, 14.3 g/dL; and platelet count, 226,000/mm3. His liver function tests were normal. Serum IgG4 or other immunoglobulin levels were not measured because there was no reason to suspect IgG4-RD at that time.\nEndoscopy with endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was performed. In endoscopic vision, a 3 × 3 cm fixed, round, hard mucosal lesion was detected on the greater curvature of the upper gastric body (Fig. ). Endoscopic biopsy showed only mild chronic gastritis. EUS revealed a mainly hypoechoic, oval with sharp margins intramural lesion developing from the muscularis propria and measuring 29.4 × 16.4 mm at its largest diameter (Fig. ). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a well-defined heterogeneously enhancing wall mass at the greater curvature of the upper gastric body (Fig. ), most likely to be a malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). No lymphadenopathy was noted.\nLaparoscopic wedge resection was performed using Endo GIATM iDrive purple 60 mm (Covedien, New Haven, CT, USA). The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on the fourth postoperative day.\nHistopathological examination of the lesion revealed a tan whitish-colored firm mass, measuring 3 × 2.8 cm, protruding from the submucosa and subserosa. On cut section, it appeared white-gray in color (Fig. ). Microscopically, storiform dense fibrosis and dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of plasma cells were identified by hematoxylin and eosin staining (Fig. A and B). On immunohistochemical staining, the tumor stained negative for anti c-kit protein and SMA; thus, GIST could be ruled out. Besides, we found IgG and IgG4-positive plasma cells in a ratio of IgG4/total IgG 40%, and a number of IgG4-positive plasma cells at approximately 60/high powered field (HPF), which indicated that the lesion could be an IgG4-related inflammatory mass (Fig. C and D).\nThe patient is presently followed up annually in our clinic.

    "question": "A 69-year-old man presented to the emergency room with two weeks of exertional dyspnea, unable to ambulate greater than 50 feet. Cardiopulmonary examination showed blood pressure of 131/82 mmHg, heart rate of 77 beats/min, a laterally displaced point of maximal impulse, bilateral dependent lung crackles, and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. Medical history included uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled hyperlipidemia, peripheral artery disease, 50 pack-year smoking history, and alcohol use disorder. No history of recreational drug use was reported. Patient had no prior surgical history. The differential diagnosis for the etiology of clinical heart failure in this patient included ischemic cardiomyopathy, alcoholic cardiomyopathy, hypertensive heart disease, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.\nOn admission, a 12-lead electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with QS waves in leads V2-V4. Laboratory studies showed troponin I of 0.04 ng/ml and brain natriuretic peptide of 2498 pg/ml. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%-35% with moderate to severe global hypokinesis. Given patient’s high likelihood of coronary artery disease, he underwent coronary angiography for workup of his cardiomyopathy, which revealed a diffusely diseased left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) with worst stenosis up to 70%-80% (Figure -).\nPatient was deemed not a candidate for coronary bypass graft surgery (CABG) by cardiothoracic surgery; thus, PCI with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) guidance was performed. The LAD lesion was crossed using a Choice PT wire (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, Massachusetts, USA) and predilated using multiple compliant balloons with good expansion. A 3.0 x 28 mm drug-eluting stent (DES) was implanted in the distal LAD, 3.5 x 38 mm DES in the mid-LAD, and 3.5 x 28 mm DES in the proximal LAD with a very good final angiographic result (Figure ). The IVUS was used prior to stent implantation for lesion characterization and vessel sizing and post-stenting to confirm adequate stent expansion and apposition without any edge dissection. However, there was an occlusion of a septal perforating artery due to being jailed by the LAD stent struts (Figure ). We opted not to intervene on this septal branch to avoid disruption of LAD stent struts. Moreover, the patient did not have any clinical signs or symptoms from losing this septal branch. He did well and was subsequently discharged on appropriate medical therapy.\nSix-month post-PCI, TTE showed improved left ventricular ejection fraction to 55%, but thinning of the midanteroseptum and midinferoseptum was noted (Figure -). No ventricular septal perforation was detected after evaluating the defect on multiple views with color Doppler. What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?",

    "question": "A 36-year-old Caucasian female attended the accident and emergency department with right-sided chest pain. The pain was described as dull and aching, with a pleuritic nature. It was sited diffusely over the right anterior and lateral chest wall and was reproducible on palpation. The pain had increased in severity over the preceding 6 weeks and at the time of admission was associated with mild dyspnea. Prior to presentation, the patient reported no weight loss, fevers or night sweats. Her family history and past medical history were unremarkable. However, she was a cigarette smoker (10 pack-year history).\nOn examination, the patient was pale and tachypnoeic. Her observations demonstrated a borderline tachycardia at 92 beats per minute and pulse oximetry of 92% on room air. On examination of the respiratory system, there was decreased expansion, dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the right hemithorax. There was no jaundice, digital clubbing, skin changes or palpable lymphadenopathy. The breast examination was unremarkable.\nInitial laboratory findings demonstrated a leukocytosis (white blood cells 18.6 × 109/L) and neutrophilia (neutrophils 15.9 × 109/L), anemia (hemoglobin 9.8 g/dL), thrombocytosis (platelets 518 × 109/L), hypercalcemia (corrected calcium 2.81 mmol/L), and raised C-reactive protein (117 mg/L).\nA chest radiograph revealed complete opacification of the right hemithorax with mild mediastinal shift to the left side (). This was further characterized by a contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis which showed a large loculated right pleural effusion with associated right lung collapse, significant multifocal right-sided pleural thickening, and multiple pulmonary nodules on the left. No abnormalities were seen below the diaphragm, save for some simple renal cysts. Appearances were reported to be likely in keeping with pleural and pulmonary metastases ().\nThe patient went on to have an ultrasound guided Seldinger chest drain inserted. Seven hundred twenty milliliters of heavily blood stained pleural fluid drained and was sent for analysis: pH 6.99, protein 52 g/L, and LDH 642 IU/L. Cytological analysis did not detect any malignant cells. The microscopy and subsequent culturing was unremarkable.\nConsidering the patient’s young age and the radiological findings, our provisional diagnosis was malignancy with a likely primary of breast, ovary, lymphoma or lung. With this in mind our patient went on to have an ultrasound examination of her breasts, which revealed some areas of benign breast changes but no focal suspicious appearances. Transvaginal ultrasound demonstrated an anteverted uterus, endometrial thickness of 5 mm and normal ovaries.\nDespite chest drain insertion and the initial volume drained, we were subsequently unable to remove a significant volume of pleural fluid from the right hemi-thorax. The patient was referred to a tertiary center with cardiothoracic facilities where video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) was performed. This allowed successful evacuation of the septated pleural effusion and the opportunity to perform pleural biopsies.\nThe histological diagnosis was confirmed by both conventional examination demonstrating the characteristic tumor cells with cords and nests, and immunohistochemistry with expression of MNF116 and CK7, D2-40, CD31 and CD34 antibodies ().\nPost-operatively our patient recovered well and was referred for specialist oncological input which she received at a quaternary London cancer center. Although an effective treatment for pleural PHE has yet to be established, Pinet et al [] have reported the case of an aggressive pleural PHE which had a complete response to treatment with carboplatin and etoposide. Our patient received weekly cycles of paclitaxel, a mitotic inhibitor, which has also demonstrated a clinical response in case reports [], for a 3-month period. Unfortunately, during this time she required frequent admissions for pain control and sadly passed away 6 months after her diagnosis.

He was diagnosed with RA more than 20 years ago but has only been on steroids in the past, more so for his lung problems. He had never been on DMARDs (Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs) treatment and never followed with a rheumatologist. His medications included Spiriva inhaler, Ventolin inhaler, and prednisone 15 mg daily. Social history was remarkable for smoking 40 years of 1.5 PPD and quit 5 months before the presentation. Family history was remarkable for RA in his mother and aunt. He admitted shortness of breath, fever, night sweat, and unintentional weight loss about 30 lbs over the past few months. Physical examination was significant for bilateral lungs wheezing on auscultation, bilateral swan neck deformity of digits, and Z deformity of bilateral thumbs. Joints range of motion was intact with no RA nodule or active synovitis. Laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cells 710/µL with 76% lymphocytes, 6.0% neutrophils, 16% monocytes, 1.0% eosinophils, and 1.0% basophils; hemoglobin 10.6 g/dL; platelet 160 000/µL; total bilirubin 0.9 mg/dL; alkaline phosphatase 68 U/L; alanine aminotransferase 18 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase 16 U/L; and serum albumin of 2.4 g/dL.

Chest X ray showed pulmonary emphysema, bibasilar subsegmental scarring, and pleural effusion. Bilateral hand X-ray showed carpal periarticular osteopenia, carpal bone erosions, and swan-neck deformity of the bilateral fifth digits. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen revealed mild splenomegaly (14 cm). Hematology/oncology was consulted. Peripheral blood smear revealed numerous large granular lymphocytes. Bone marrow biopsy and aspiration were reported as insufficient for diagnosis. Immunophenotyping of bone marrow revealed an increased number of T-cell lymphocytes about 91% of cells analyzed with marked aberrant loss of CD5 and moderate loss of CD7. CD4:CD8 ratio was markedly decreased (0.23) with an abnormal increase in CD8 cells. NK cells were within normal limits.

Blood chemistry data revealed severe increases in C-reactive protein (346 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (55 mm/hr), with mildly elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase (127 and 175 IU/L). Bilirubin, albumin, and other blood component chemistries were all within the normal range.\nPlain radiographs of the chest and abdomen were unremarkable. Pre-contrast and contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed an approximately 6.0 cm, ill-defined heterogeneous enhancing hypodense mass lesion in the gastrocolic ligament (). The mass extended to its peripheries, with ill-defined infiltration of the surrounding omentum. Radiologists called for further workup to differentiate among metastatic mass, primary omental tumor, and omental infarction.\nViral and tumor markers, including carcinoembryonic antigens, alpha-fetoproteins, CA 19-9, and CA 125, were within normal ranges. Gastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy showed simple chronic gastritis. Abdominal ultrasonography displayed an ill-defined, heterogeneous echogenic mass between the stomach and transverse colon (). Further imaging with positron emission tomography CT revealed a large intense hypermetabolic mass in the gastrocolic ligaments without evidence of metastasis. An exploratory laparotomy was consequently performed under the impression of necrotic tumorous lesion.\nThe operative field revealed a 4-cm crab leg embedded within the approximately 6-cm abscess in the perforated antrum of the stomach (). Streptococcus sp. was cultured from the abscess. The patient underwent antrectomy, vagotomy, and transverse colon wedge resection. A detailed history taken after surgery uncovered the Kanjang-gaejang ingestion three weeks before, one day prior to the onset of abdominal pain. Twenty days after admission, the patient was discharged from the hospital with no complications. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 90-year-old male who presented with symptoms of general weakness and poor oral intake visited the emergency department of our hospital. He was diagnosed with hepatitis C-related liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in our hospital. Abdominal computed tomography had been performed about one month previously and had revealed multiple viable HCCs in both lobes of the liver. Their largest diameter was 10.7 cm (). The patient's HCC was classified as stage B according to the Barcelona Clinic Cancer staging classification. He had undergone radio frequency thermal ablation (RFTA) once and TACE six times in our hospital. Two days ago he visited our outpatient clinic with symptoms such as general weakness, nausea, and vomiting. Because the symptoms had suggested adrenal insufficiency, he had been empirically administered prednisolone 10mg per day by the oral route for two days. ACTH stimulation test couldn't be performed at our outpatient clinic and the patient refused the test. Else he had been taking furosemide 20 mg, aldactone 50 mg a day. Before taking prednisolone, serum creatinine was 1.12 mg/dL, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 65 mL/min/1.73 m2, and his renal function had been well preserved considering his age.\nThe patient's vital signs were within normal limits at our emergency department. On physical examination, the abdomen was distended, without tenderness or rebound tenderness. A complete blood cell count showed mild leukocytosis with mild anemia: leukocytes, 14.4 × 103/µL; hemoglobin, 10.8 g/dL; and platelets, 180 × 103/µL. The following additional laboratory values were found: serum sodium, 145 mEq/L; potassium, 5.4 mEq/L; chloride 110 mEg/L; bicarbonate 24.0 mEq/L; total protein, 7.1 g/dL; albumin, 3.0 g/dL calcium, 8.7 mg/dL; inorganic phosphorus, 5.8 mg/dL. In addition, serum urea nitrogen level was 100.5 mg/dL, creatinine level was 3.00 mg/dL, eGFR was 21 mL/min/1.73 m2. AST was 310 U/L, ALT was 171 U/L, total bilirubin was 5.24 mg/dl, prothrombin time was 12.5 sec, α-fetoprotein (AFP) was 647.4 ng/mL. His Child-Turcotte-Pugh score was 9. Chest radiography revealed only an old tuberculosis lesion in the right upper lung zone. His electrocardiogram was normal. Because he had acute kidney damage, and adequate hydration could not correct it, hepatorenal syndrome was suspected. He was treated by intravenous hydration at first, and was also administered terlipressin and albumin.\nThough serum uric acid was 8.0 mg/dL about 6 months ago, the following day, serum uric acid increased to 18.3 mg/dL. Serum sodium was 146 mEq/L, potassium was 5.4 mEq/L, inorganic phosphorus was 6.2 mg/dL, calcium was 8.7 mg/dL, serum urea nitrogen level was 104.6 mg/dL, creatinine level was 2.90 mg/dL, and eGFR was 22 mL/min/1.73 m2. Though oliguria was not present, his urine output was lower than a day earlier. Hydration and treatment for hepatorenal syndrome were maintained.\nIn next day, he had severe metabolic acidosis and acute kidney injury. Multiple organ failure progressed steadily, and he expired three days after admission. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 16-year-old female patient presented with a history of fever, joint pains, amenorrhea and generalized body swelling since 6 months. Fever was of high grade, intermittent in nature, associated with erythematous rashes which were localized to the upper trunk and back. Joint pains mainly involved the elbow and knee joints, and were associated with redness and swelling restricting movement. There was a history of recurrent oral ulcers, decreased appetite and significant weight loss. There was no history of urinary disturbances, bleeding tendencies, abdominal distension, altered bowel habits, altered mentation, photosensitivity or bluish discoloration of skin/mucous membranes. There was no past history of delayed developmental milestones, blood transfusions, diabetes, or thy. There was no family thyroid disease or any other chronic illness. No family member suffered from a similar disease.\nOn general examination, the patient was febrile with an oral temperature of 39.6°C. Vitals were within normal limits. Pallor, pedal edema and facial puffiness were evident. There were enlarged, non-tender, mobile lymph nodes present in the cervical region. Erythematous, non-tender, non-blanchable rashes were present over the chest and upper back (). Per abdomen examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly. Cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous system examination was essentially normal. On musculoskeletal examination, the patient had tenderness over bilateral hip joints, knee joints and small joints of hands (proximal interphalangeal joints and metacarpophalangeal joints) associated with swelling and redness.\nOn the day of patient admission the laboratory investigations revealed some abnormalities including anemia with hemoglobin of 7.9 g/dl, leukopenia with a leukocyte count of 3000/mm3, and platelet count of 150 × 103/µl. Renal function parameters were normal with blood urea of 18 mg/dl (10–50), serum creatinine 0.6 mg/dl (0.7–1.3), serum uric acid 5.1 mg/dl (4–7), serum calcium 7.9 mg/dl (8.5–10.5) and serum phosphate 3.4 mg/dl (2.5–4.5). Random blood sugar of the patient was 93 mg/dl. Liver function tests were slightly deranged, with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 60 U/l (up to 40), serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 79 U/l (up to 40), serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) 243 U/l (30–117), total serum bilirubin 0.8 mg/dl (0.2–0.8) and serum total protein 6 g/dl. The lipid profile was within the normal range. Anemia work-up showed MCV (mean corpuscular volume) of 125.4 fl/cell, MCH (mean corpuscular hemoglobin) 37.3 pg/cell, and MCHC (mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration) 30.1 g/dl, revealing a macrocytic picture. The corrected reticulocyte count was 0.16% and the serum ferritin level was 1144.6 µg/l.\nDirect and indirect Coombs’ tests were negative, and hemoglobin electrophoresis was normal. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was raised with a value of 140 mm/1st hour. The serum fibrinogen level was 280 mg/dl. Additional investigations included raised C-reactive protein (CRP; 100 mg/dl), negative antinuclear antibodies (ANA), negative rheumatoid factor (RF) and negative anti-dsDNA. Anti-SS-A/Ro antibodies, anti-SS-B/La antibodies and HLA-B27 were negative. To rule out infectious causes of fever a series of tests was performed: the malaria card test, Widal test, serology for Leptospira, Leishmania and scrub typhus, blood and urine cultures, Mantoux test, HIV antibodies, Hbs-antigen and anti-HCV antibodies. We also performed a heterophile test for Epstein-Barr virus infection and excluded presence of antibodies in IgM/IgG class to parvovirus B19 and autoantibodies for cytomegalovirus. None of the performed tests confirmed viral or bacterial infection.\nEye examination was normal. Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed hepatosplenomegaly and presence of free fluid. Echocardiography was normal. Lymph node biopsy showed diffuse follicular hyperplasia which suggested a chronic inflammatory state. Bone marrow aspiration revealed megaloblastic erythropoiesis. Minor salivary gland biopsy was undertaken to exclude Sjögren's syndrome, but there were no typical inflammatory infiltrates. Radiological investigations included X-ray of chest, hands and knees and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sacroiliac spine, which were normal (, ).\nIn view of the patient being a 16-year-old female with a history of fever, polyarthritis and rash, examination revealing hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy, and investigations showing high ESR and ferritin values, with absence of ANA and RF, a possible diagnosis of systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis was established.\nAs the patient had moderate to high grade fever, generalized edema, swollen and tender joints, and poor general condition, a possible association of JIA with MAS was suspected. The presence of ferritin > 684 ng/ml, platelet count of ≤ 181 × 109/l, AST level 79 U/l and serum fibrinogen level of 280 mg/dl satisfied the 2016 criteria for classification of MAS in sJIA, and hence the diagnosis was made.\nDuring the course of hospital stay, the patient received anti-inflammatory therapy, blood transfusions, glucocorticoids and methotrexate. The patient recovered dramatically within a span of two weeks. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

She presented similarly 6 years before. At that time, computed tomography (CT) scan was suspicious for hydatid cyst, and local hospital echinococcal antibodies were positive. However, sent-out repeat tests were negative. The patient denied contact with animals but did have multiple visits to Jerusalem. Given low epidemiology in the United States, negative repeat tests and low suspicion, the patient was scheduled to undergo hepatic cyst resection for diagnosis, but she was lost to follow-up. On this admission, the patient was afebrile and had scleral icterus with mildly jaundiced skin. Laboratory results revealed eosinophilia (white blood cell count of 7,200/µL with absolute eosinophil count of 710/µL, Hb of 14 g/dL and platelet count of 299,000/µL) with biliary pattern liver function tests that showed alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 367 U/L with total bilirubin of 3.5 mg/dL and direct bilirubin of 3.0 mg/dL with elevated transaminases (aspartate transaminase (AST) 136 U/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 244 U/L). This time, echinococcal antibodies were positive for both local and sent-out ones. Ultrasound showed cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis and calcified right hepatic cystic lesion. CT scan demonstrated large hepatic hypodense lesion with thick calcified rim (). Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed hepatic cyst along with dilated central bile ducts and abrupt narrowing at the biliary confluence (). The endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) revealed mild stenosis in the upper third of the common bile duct (CBD) from external compression, and the copious mucus obtained through balloon sweeps showed scolices. Based on the presentation and workup, the patient was diagnosed with HLD concerning for cystobiliary fistula and was started on albendazole. The patient was scheduled for cholecystectomy and surgical cyst removal. Since the cyst was densely adherent to the right hepatic vein and inferior vena cava, radical resection was impractical. Therefore, she underwent partial cystectomy, cystobiliary fistula repair and omentoplasty. Subsequent intraoperative cholangiogram showed no leak (). However, 2 weeks after the surgery, the patient developed a refractory biliary leak for which aggressive endotherapy, necrosectomy procedures and cystobiliary fistula embolization failed (). The case was further complicated by hepatic abscess and colonic fistula that required multiple admissions and variable antibiotic courses, and for which the patient is planned to undergo percutaneous closure. Probable next step, per multidisciplinary team discussions, is right hepatectomy with or without Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, and right hemicolectomy with diverting loop ileostomy.

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed multiple ill-defined consolidations and cavitations in all lobes of both lungs with the absence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy (). The patient underwent a CT-guided lung biopsy. A histopathology study revealed many oval shaped, budding yeast-form fungal micro-organisms in the cytoplasm of CD68(+) alveolar macrophages (), which was clearly identified by Periodic acid-Schiff and Gomori Methenamine Silver stains. The patient was diagnosed with chronic cavitary pulmonary histoplasmosis. Therapy was initiated with 200 mg itraconazole orally three times per day for 3 days and maintained with 200 mg orally twice per day for 12 months.

    "question": "A 76-year-old male presented to the emergency department with recurrent painless bleeding from his ileal conduit site. This was his fifth visit to the hospital with similar complaints. He had a history of muscle invasive bladder cancer with peri-vesical tissue involvement, for which he underwent radical cystoprostatectomy with ileal conduit urinary diversion 7 years prior to presentation, after which he was lost to follow up. He did not take chemotherapy or radiation. He also had a history of Stage III chronic kidney disease, alcohol use of approximately 2–3 cans of beer daily for the last 40 years, and a history of medication non-compliance and non-compliance with follow-up appointments. He denied any history of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, back pain, blood in stools, hematemesis, or any other site of bleeding. He gave a history of fatigue, dizziness, and on and off painless bleeding from his ileal conduit site for over a year. At presentation, his heart rate was 103 beats/min, blood pressure was 126/60 mmHg, and respiratory rate was 18/min, saturating at 91% on room air. His examination was unremarkable except for gross bleed in his urostomy bag with blood clots. [His investigations revealed a hemoglobin of 3.8 g/dL (13.5–17.5), white blood cell count of 6.1 K/μL (4–11 K/μL), platelet count 114 K/μL (140–400), International Normalised ratio (INR) 1.38 (0.85–1.12), prothrombin time 17.6 s (12.1–15.0), total bilirubin 0.7 mg/dL (0–1.3), aspartate aminotransferase 40 U/L (14–59), alanine aminotransferase 36 U/L (11–66), and alkaline phosphatase 69 (38–126 U/L).] The patient's creatinine was elevated at presentation at 2.78 mg/dL (0.50–1.30), from his baseline creatinine of 1.32 mg/dL (estimated glomerular filtration rate = 56 ml/min/1.73 m2). After volume resuscitation, his creatinine improved to 1.4 mg/dL. He was transfused with packed red blood cells (PRBC's). His noncontrast computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis showed subtle nodularity of liver contour and mild splenomegaly (14.1 cm in length). Flexible cystourethroscopy through ileal conduit showed a small area of hemorrhage in the anterior portion of the conduit just deep to the abdominal wall fascia. The hemorrhagic site was fulgurated without evidence of other bleeding sites. On further examination, purple discoloration of the ileal stomal site was noticed []. Given his recurrent episodes of bleeding from the stomal site, purplish discoloration of the skin around the stoma, and liver nodularity, there was a high degree of suspicion of underlying liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension and extrahepatic peristomal varices. He underwent CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast, which showed heterogeneous density and enhancement of the liver, nodularity of the liver edge, and parastomal varices with mild ascites []. He was treated conservatively with octreotide for variceal bleeding. During the evaluation of his liver cirrhosis, his hepatitis C antibody was reactive, and his hepatitis C RNA load was 121012 IU/mL. Evaluation for hepatitis B was negative; abdominal Doppler did not show any portal venous thrombosis. His model for end-stage liver disease score at the time of TIPS procedure was 16 points, 6% estimated 3-month mortality. He successfully underwent TIPS with portosystemic pressure gradient reduction from 10 to 4 mmHg in addition to the coil embolization of ileal conduit varices by an interventional radiologist. The patient was advised to follow up with hepatology and gastroenterology for further evaluation for cirrhosis and treatment of his hepatitis C infection, respectively, and with endoscopy for evaluation of esophageal varices. He was seen in the hepatology clinic at 5 months; at which time he did not have any new episode of bleeding He was lost to follow-up after that appointment.

The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) five days before coming to the hospital. Physical examination revealed hypoxia with decreased lung sounds and negative abdominal findings. Her labs on initial presentation revealed white blood count 21.2x109/L (normal range = 4.5 to 11.0 x 10^9/L), hemoglobin 15.1 gm/dl (normal range = 12 to 15.5 gm/dl), prothrombin time 12 seconds (normal range = 11 to 12.5 seconds), international normalized ratio (INR) 1.2 (normal range = < 1.1), fibrinogen 620 mg/dl (normal range = 200 to 400 mg/dL), D-dimer 2.03 mcg/mL fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU) (normal range < 0.5 mcg/mL FEU), blood glucose 430 mg/dl (normal range < 140 mg/dL) with an elevated anion gap, lactate 3.4 mmol/L (normal range = 0.5 to 1 mmol/L), and normal total bilirubin/liver enzymes.\nCT chest revealed extensive consolidative airspace opacities with ground glass opacities while the CT abdomen was normal (Figure ). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for diabetic ketoacidosis and progressive respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation on day 2 of hospitalization. Her pulmonary condition was further complicated by pulmonary edema likely related to cytokine release syndrome. She was initially treated with hydroxychloroquine and as her inflammatory markers continued to rise, she was administered tocilizumab on the day of intubation. Two days after the tocilizumab, the patient also received COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Her ICU course was further prolonged by superimposed bacterial infections including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, treated with vancomycin, aztreonam, and meropenem, as well as fungal urinary tract infection, treated with fluconazole. She was successfully extubated eleven days later and was transitioned to the step-down unit.\nOn day 15 of admission, the patient developed severe right upper quadrant pain and back pain.Her complete blood count revealed hemoglobin of 6.1 gm/dl (normal range = 12 to 15.5 gm/dl), platelet count of 217,000/microliter of blood (normal range = 150,000 to 400,00/microliter of blood). The coagulation panel showed a prothrombin time of 13 seconds (normal range = 11 to 12.5 seconds) and an INR of 1.3 (normal < 1.1). Comprehensive metabolic panel revealed a sudden increase in liver enzymes with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 1111U/L (normal range = 5 to 40 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 1020 U/L (normal range = 19 to 25 U/L), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 203 IU/L (normal range = 44 to 147 IU/L) with normal total bilirubin (normal range = 0.1 to 1. 2 mg/dL). CT abdomen without contrast revealed a heterogeneous attenuation pattern area in the right hepatic lobe (Figure ). A follow-up ultrasound abdomen with Doppler confirmed patent vasculature. We obtained a three-phase liver CT with contrast which showed large areas of heterogeneous hypodensity and heterogenous enhancement most consistent with intraparenchymal hemorrhage (Figure ). At this point, the patient's hemoglobin had also dropped by 2 gm/dl but fecal occult blood was negative, ruling out any gastrointestinal lumen bleeding. The patient was transfused with two units of packed red blood cells and her prophylactic anticoagulation was held.\nWhile admitted, the patient’s AST peaked at 2177 U/L, ALT peaked at 1881 U/L and ALP peaked at 369 U/L. After discussing with the gastroenterology team, we started her on a trial of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for her acute liver injury. Labs after a 21-hour infusion of NAC revealed a drastic and rapid improvement of her transaminitis. CT abdomen was repeated the next day which showed stabilization in the heterogeneous area in the right hepatic lobe. The patient continued to improve from the cardiorespiratory and gastrointestinal point of view and was discharged to an acute care rehab facility with normalized liver enzymes.

    "question": "A 35-year-old female with ESRD was admitted to our hospital 2 years ago. She had a history of aplastic anaemia since she was 11 years old and was complicated by chronic hepatitis C probably due to frequent blood transfusion. She underwent peripheral blood stem cell transplantation at the age of 32. Her renal function deteriorated rapidly after the treatment. She started PD with the regimen of a single 6-h dwell of 2 L glucose dialysate. Considering that her genotype of HCV was 2a, which is known to be more susceptible to IFN therapy than genotype 1, and that she was a candidate for cadaveric kidney transplant, we decided to treat her with PEG-IFN alpha-2a (Pegasys&#61650, Hoffmann-LaRoche, Basel, Switzerland) monotherapy 1 year after the beginning of PD.\nLaboratory results before introduction of PEG-IFN were as follows: white blood cell count, 7000/μL; neutrophil count, 56%; haemoglobin, 9.9 g/dL; platelet count, 261 000/μL; serum albumin, 3.9 g/dL; aspartate transferase, 13 IU/L; alanine transferase, 16 IU/L and HCV-RNA, 3600 KIU/ml. Because IFN may adversely affect residual renal function, we adopted a dose escalation strategy in order to minimize the total dose of PEG-IFN. Thus, the treatment was initiated at a dose of 30 μg subcutaneously once a week for the first 6 weeks, being escalated to a maximum dose of 90 μg over the next 4 weeks and continued for subsequent 38 weeks. The plasma HCV-RNA levels decreased to be undetectable at the 17th week and constantly negative thereafter. During the PEG-IFN therapy, flu-like symptoms and progression of anaemia were observed, which were treated by a transient cessation of PEG-IFN therapy for a couple of weeks and an increase in the dose of erythropoietin, respectively. The residual renal function remained stable during the course of 48 weeks (renal Kt/V; from 1.28 to 1.26). Six months after the end of the treatment, sustained virological response (SVR) was achieved. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 17-year-old girl visited Chungbuk National University Hospital, presenting with fever and abdominal pain that had developed 7 days previously. She had undergone an operation for gastroschisis repair at birth. At the time of admission, her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 120/80 mm Hg; pulse rate, 70 beats per minute; respiration rate, 18 breaths per minute; and body temperature, 37.5℃. She appeared emaciated and acutely ill. Her body mass index was 18.1 (height, 151 cm; and weight, 41.3 kg). A physical examination revealed icteric sclera, a very thin abdominal cavity, and a longitudinal surgical scar at the midline. Tenderness was noted in the upper abdominal area, and normal bowel sounds were heard. There was no particular finding in the limb or neurological examinations. Laboratory analysis revealed a white blood cell count of 27,000 cells/mm3; hemoglobin level, 12.3 g/dL; platelet count, 277,000 cells/mm3; aspartate aminotransferase level, 108 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase level, 144 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase level, 476 IU/L; total protein level, 6.5 g/dL; albumin level, 3.7 g/dL; total bilirubin level, 14.1 mg/dL; direct bilirubin level, 9.2 mg/dL; amylase level, 592 U/L; lipase level, 825 U/L; blood urea nitrogen level, 5.0 mg/dL; and creatinine level, 0.5 mg/dL. These data were compatible with diagnoses of acute cholangitis and acute biliary pancreatitis. An abdominal computed tomography scan revealed a round calcifying lesion near the pancreas (), and the absence of the retroperitoneal duodenum and the anterior position of the spleen with respect to the left kidney. The anterior and left-sided position of the superior mesenteric vein compared with that of the superior mesenteric artery was observed in the abdominal computed tomography scan (). The coronal view revealed the distorted architecture of the liver and a high-attenuation lesion at the extrahepatic bile duct (). Results of a barium examination revealed a right-sided duodenojejunal flexure and malpositioning of the bowel, with the small bowel on the right side and the colon on the left side (). Intestinal malrotation could be diagnosed based on these findings. ERCP was performed by using a lateral-view endoscope in the usual way. After approaching the ampulla, the endoscope was pushed against the duodenal wall to maintain the papilla in the correct position, and a selective bile duct cannulation confirmed the presence of a 12-mm round stone in the common bile duct. With a guidewire-assisted technique, the single dark brown stone was removed by using a Dormia basket after the endoscopic sphincterotomy (). The procedure lasted for 15 minutes. A cholangiogram obtained through an endoscopic nasobiliary drainage tube revealed a distorted biliary system, which was characterized with diffuse dilatation of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary trees, downward-positioned gallbladder and a right intrahepatic biliary tree, and a horizontally located common bile duct. The abnormal orientation of the duodenum suggested intestinal malrotation (). Clinical symptoms and liver function tests normalized after the ERCP procedure. The patient has been monitored for 3 years and is in a normal state. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 42-year-old man was referred to our hospital for treatment after intentionally ingesting fertilizer containing 100% sodium silicate. He had ingested about 50 mL of fertilizer 2 days prior to admission. On presentation, he complained of a sore throat and epigastric pain. The patient had a medical history of unmedicated chronic hepatitis B and had worked in a car-manufacturing factory for 10 years. He had a 20 pack-year smoking history. On admission, his blood pressure was 130/78 mmHg, pulse rate was 98 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute, and body temperature was 38.3°C. He had mild painful oral erosion and his lungs sounded clear to auscultation. Laboratory results from another hospital immediately after the ingestion had revealed the following findings: serum creatinine (Cr), 1.1 mg/dL; white blood cell (WBC) count, 113,600 cells/μL; the arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) results were as follows: pH, 7.340; PCO2, 40.3 mmHg; PO2, 96.8 mmHg; HCO3, 21.2 mm/L; and O2 saturation, 96.8% on room air. On admission to our hospital, laboratory findings were as follows: hemoglobin, 16.3 g/dL; WBC count, 23,290 cells/μL; platelet count, 167,000 cells/μL; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 48 mg/dL; serum Cr, 5.06 mg/dL; total bilirubin, 1.7 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 68 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 43 U/L; and glucose, 140 mg/dL. ABGA results were as follows: pH, 7.415; PCO2, 36.6 mmHg; PO2, 73 mmHg; HCO3, 25.5 mm/L; and O2 saturation, 95% on room air. Urinary analysis revealed a pH of 6.0, specific gravity of 1.010, 2+ protein, 2+ glucose, trace occult blood, and no WBCs, with proteinuria at 550 mg/day. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) titers were below 1 : 40 (nuclear pattern) and results for other serologic markers were nonspecific. Abdominal sonography revealed increased kidney size with increased parenchymal echogenicity.\nDespite continuous fluid therapy, the patient's levels of BUN and Cr increased gradually, and thus renal biopsy was performed on day 3 of admission. The kidney biopsy showed acute tubular necrosis without infiltration of inflammatory cells. Although the histologic findings were not diffuse, definite features of tubular damage were noted. Necrotic sloughing of tubular cells was found, with mitotic figures present in regenerating tubular cells. Necrotic cellular casts were also noted in the tubular lumina (). Ultrastructural examination revealed electron-dense deposits in subendothelium of glomerular capillaries. And focal effacement and fusion of foot processes of podocytes were noted (). Tubular cells contained electron-dense lysosomes in the cytoplasm and lumina ().\nThe development of acute respiratory distress syndrome was observed on day 4: arterial PaO2/FiO2 < 100 mmHg. Corticosteroid therapy for acute lung injury was administered for 28 days, beginning on day 5 (1 mg/kg/day of intravenous methylprednisolone for 2 weeks, followed by a 2-week taper). Hemodialysis was provided 5 times from day 5 to day 10 for the treatment of hyperkalemia and oliguria. After the termination of hemodialysis, the patient's renal function recovered completely. During the administration of corticosteroid therapy, pulmonary fibrosis was observed on chest computed tomography. On day 16, bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous emphysema occurred. Although bilateral closed tube thoracotomy and a lung protective ventilation strategy were applied, the pneumothorax and pulmonary fibrosis progressed gradually. The patient died of complicated lung fibrosis and persistent pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum on day 40 of hospitalization. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 38-year-old Taiwanese man having a history of alcoholic liver cirrhosis, without regular medical follow-up, was admitted to the hospital. Right flank pain had occurred 10 days before this admission, and treatment was then prescribed for a muscle strain at a rural hospital. The pain, which radiated to the right upper abdomen, was accompanied with a fever, which developed for 3 days. The patient was then referred to our hospital for further analysis and management. Upon arrival to our hospital, his vital signs included a respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, a heart rate of 122 beats/min, blood pressure of 120/72 mm Hg, and a body temperature of 39.5°C. A physical examination revealed mild pale conjunctiva, rapid regular heart beats, tenderness, and rebounding pain over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, and also a knocking tenderness over the right flank region. Laboratory tests uncovered a white blood cell count (WBC) of 31,700/mm3, with segmented neutrophils at 96.6%, hemoglobin at 10.8 g/dL, platelet counts of 407 × 103/mm3, blood urea nitrogen at 50 mg/dL, creatinine at 2.7 mg/dL, lactate at 16.3 mg/dL, albumin at 2.3 g/dL, glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase at 122 U/L, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase at 49 U/L, lactate dehydrogenase at 486 U/L, alkaline phosphatase at 432 U/L, C-reactive protein at 40.4 mg/dL, blood glucose at 106 mg/dL, along with other test result levels which were unremarkable. A CT scan demonstrated fluid accumulation at the right subphrenic and retroperitoneal spaces, multiple cystic lesions within the right kidney, along with an irregular surface of the kidney adjacent to retroperitoneal fluid (Fig. ). Purulent fluid was aspirated from the right subphrenic space for analysis, with the results indicating there was a WBC of 78,750/mm3, with an 85% level of segmented neutrophils. Percutaneous catheters were implanted for drainage of the right subphrenic and retroperitoneal abscesses using ceftriaxone at 2000 mg once daily. Six days later, an uncontrolled sepsis persisted due to the patient's failure to respond to medical treatment. Subsequently, a nephrectomy for the renal abscess was carried out involving debridement of the retroperitoneal abscess. Anaerobic cultures of the right subphrenic and retroperitoneal abscess grew both A israelii and Bacteroides fragilis. Aerobic cultures of the ascites and abscess uncovered no traces of bacteria. An anaerobic culture of the nephrectomy specimen yielded A israelii. Anaerobic, aerobic bacterial, and fungal cultures of the patient's blood and urine proved to be negative. Acid fast stain and cultures for tuberculosis were not found in either the urine or nephrectomy specimen. The pathologic results revealed multiple renal abscesses involving actinomycosis with the characteristics of sulfur granules (Fig. ). A full course of antibiotics with intravenous penicillin G (3 million units every 4 hours) was prescribed for 2 weeks, followed by oral penicillin V given at a dose of 2 grams per day for 6 months at our out-patient facility.\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and all accompanying images.

He has been taking an angiotensin receptor blocker and digoxin due to hypertension and heart failure. He has suffered from repeated episodes of epistaxis from his teens and gastrointestinal bleeding from his mid-thirties. All of his five children also had the history of recurrent epistaxis. Also his sister was suffering from the sequelae of cerebrovascular accident. On physical examination, several telangiectatic macular lesions were found on his arms and trunk (). The laboratory work-up at first visit revealed the following: WBC, 4.6×103/mm3; platelet, 172×103/mm3; hemoglobin, 12.6 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 42 IU/L; alanine aminotranferase (ALT), 20 IU/L; hepatitis B virus surface antigen, positive; hepatitis B surface antibody, negative; anti-hepatitis C virus antibody, negative; and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), 345 ng/mL (normal, 0-20). Other laboratory results including bleeding time, coagulation time, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were normal. Gastroduodenal endoscopy disclosed a telangiectasia at the lesser curvature in mid-body of the stomach (). Liver dynamic CT (LDCT) revealed multiple HCCs in the right lobe of liver and there was no evidence of distant metastasis or vascular invasion. The HCC lesions showed heterogenous wash-out compared to well enhancing round homogenous AVMs in delayed phase of LDCT ().\nLiver transplantation was recommended, however, the patient refused it due to economic problem. TACE was performed in three consecutive sessions, but lipiodol uptake in the tumor mass was very poor at every session. HCC progressed after each TACE session. Fever developed up to 38℃, and AST and/or ALT increased more than two times of baseline following the first two TACE sessions.\nBecause of unusual TACE effect, we reviewed all the radiologic images of the patient and found an enlarged tortuous hepatic artery, multiple arteriovenous malformations, and early visualization of hepatic veins in LDCT () and hepatic angiography (). Based on these findings and positive family history, he was diagnosed as Osler-Weber-Rendu disease and genetic tests for the ENG and ACVRL1 were performed. Patient's genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood using the QuickGene DNA blood kit (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) and BigDye Terminatore V3.1 Cycle Sequencing Ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA, USA). Fourteen and ten exons and their intronic flanking sequences of the ENG and ACVRL1, respectively, were amplified by polymerase chain reaction with appropriate primers ( and ). The molecular genetic analysis for the whole exons with their flanking sequences of the ENG was negative. However, the patient harbors a deletion mutation, c.145del (p.Ala49ProfsX5), in the ACVRL, the diagnosis of HHT type 2 with hepatic involvement was confirmed by the results of genetic study.

On hospital day 2, his WBC count was 19,800/mm3, glucose 338 mg/dL and ammonia 78 umol/L. Pulmonary function testing showed a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 2.34 L (88% of predicted), forced vital capacity (FVC) of 2.69 L (71% of predicted) and diffusing capacity of 19.9 mL/min/mm Hg (92% of predicted). Urine culture yielded Enterococcus faecalis, 50,000 colonies/mL. The patient remained afebrile, but that evening, he had increased lethargy and encephalopathy. His ammonia level rose acutely to 197 umol/L. His lactulose and neomycin were increased.\nOn day 3, the patient’s ammonia was 45 umol/L; he had brief episodes of atrial tachycardia. ECG showed sinus rhythm and nonspecific T-wave changes. Chest x-ray showed mild bilateral interstitial pulmonary edema and a left pleural effusion. Echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular size and function, but mild mitral regurgitation. Over the next 3 days, the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable but had increasing jaundice. On day 6, he complained of dyspnea on exertion as well as feeling tired, weak and sleepy. He was afebrile. His WBC count rose to 31,900/mm3 (90% segmented neutrophils, 5% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes).\nOn day 8, the patient was lethargic and slightly confused. His ammonia was 60 umol/L, bilirubin 25.5 mg/dL, albumin 2.2 g/dL, ALT 109 U/L, BUN 26 mg/dL and creatinine 2.5 mg/dL. He was given prednisone and zinc. Over the next 3 days, the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable but had increasing bilirubin, BUN and creatinine. He developed fine bibasilar pulmonary crackles with moderate pulmonary edema, along with left pleural effusion and cardiomegaly on chest x-ray, which was treated with furosemide.

    "question": "A 30-year-old female with acute hepatitis was referred to our hospital in 1995. She had been asymptomatic until the disease onset. She had no history of significant medical condition, blood transfusion, or daily intake of medicine and did not consume alcohol. Her serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level had fluctuated from 300 to 1116 IU/L for 3 months before admission. On admission, laboratory examinations revealed total bilirubin 2.5 mg/dL, aspartate transaminase (AST) 842 IU/L, ALT 956 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 153 IU/L, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase 68 IU/L, γ-globulin 2.3 g/dL, and immunoglobulin G 2,710 mg/dL. Hepatitis B virus surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody were negative, antinuclear antibody was weakly positive (1:40, homogeneous), anti-smooth muscle antibody was positive (1:320), and anti-mitochondrial antibody was negative. Human leukocyte antigen was positive for DR-4. Histological analysis of the liver revealed marked interface hepatitis with rosette formation in the parenchyma. On the basis of these findings, she was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis and started on prednisolone (30 mg/day). Her serum ALT level gradually declined. Her prednisolone dose was tapered to 10–15 mg/day, which was administered with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA; 600 mg/day) to maintain her ALT level <40 IU/L. Since 2002, she had been treated by a doctor at home, and the aforementioned regimen was continued. In 2008, she developed steroid-induced cataract and was referred to our hospital to consult about treatment options for autoimmune hepatitis. At the time of referral, she was 150 cm in height and weighed 43.5 kg (body mass index 19.3 kg/m2), and she was being administered 12.5 mg/day of prednisolone and 600 mg/day of UDCA, and her serum AST and ALT levels were 23 and 34 IU/L, respectively. We added azathioprine (100 mg/day) to this regimen and gradually tapered the prednisolone dose to 10 mg/day; her ALT level was maintained between 22 and 40 IU/L with occasional mild flare-ups. In May 2012, she complained shortness of breath and easy fatigability and significant pallor was noted on physical examination. A hemogram revealed hemoglobin 6.4 g/dL, mean red cell volume 117.3 fL, reticulocyte count 0.6 %, white blood cell count 2,600 cells/μL, and platelet count 207,000 cells/μL. Laboratory serum analyses revealed total protein 6.0 g/dL, albumin 3.7 g/dL, AST 32 IU/L, ALT 42 IU/L, lactic acid dehydrogenase 221 IU/L, and normal bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels. Her serum iron level was 214 μg/dL, erythropoietin level was 3,750 mIU (normal 9.1–32.8 mIU), and vitamin B12 and folic acid levels were 307 pg/mL (normal 233–914 pg/mL) and 3.3 ng/mL (normal 3.6–12.9 ng/mL), respectively. She showed no symptoms of recent infection, such as fever or myalgia, and gastrointestinal endoscopy showed no evidence of hemorrhagic lesions. She was initially suspected of having azathioprine-induced anemia; therefore, azathioprine was discontinued. A red cell transfusion was performed, which increased her hemoglobin level to 8.3 g/dL; however, after 4 weeks, her hemoglobin levels decreased to 6.1 g/dL (Fig. ). Another transfusion was performed; however, severe anemia kept recurring and repeat transfusions were required. Her reticulocyte count was consistently low (0.2–0.6 %) except just after transfusion. In July 2012, bone marrow aspiration was performed, which revealed hypocellular bone marrow with an absence of erythroblasts. Giant proerythroblast was not observed and her serum was negative for immunoglobulin (Ig)M antibody to parvovirus B19, although viral DNA was not examined. Therefore, she was diagnosed with acquired PRCA on the basis of these findings, and CsA was administered on September 2012 at an initial dose of 6 mg/kg/day (250 mg/day). After 7 weeks, her hemoglobin level and reticulocyte count both showed considerable improvement (12.4 g/dL and 2.4 %, respectively). The CsA dose was gradually reduced and maintained at 1.6 mg/kg/day (70 mg/day) since April 2013, without relapse of anemia. Her cyclosporine trough blood level has ranged from 69 to 88 ng/mL. In October 2012, UDCA was discontinued and the prednisolone dose was tapered to 9 mg/day; prednisolone has been maintained at 8 mg/day since January 2013. The mild fluctuations in serum AST and ALT levels noted after azathioprine discontinuation ceased after initiating CsA therapy. Her AST and ALT levels have remained <20 IU/L for 8 months since the initiation of therapy. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

The patient had history of essential thrombocythemia (ET) and hemolytic anemia since 12 and 7 years ago consecutively. The ET was diagnosed based on bone marrow biopsy done that showed proliferation of megakaryocytes, not meeting other myelodysplastic syndrome. He was treated with hydroxyurea for 5 years and then substituted with azathioprine due to possible of hydroxyurea-induced hemolytic anemia. The patient was diagnosed of hemolytic anemia as the immunoglobulin G (IgG) on Coombs test was positive. Approximately 3 years ago, the patient experienced abdominal enlargement with tenderness on the upper left quadrant of the abdomen. Noncontrast abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan examination was done and the results showed hepatic cirrhosis, splenomegaly, portal hypertension and ascites. He had history of packed red cell transfusion due to anemia 7 years ago. A year before admission, he experienced mutiple episodes of hematemesis and melena that caused anemia and series of packed red cell transfusion. He underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which showed rupture of esophageal varives, which was then ligated ( and 2).\nAt admission, the patient was compos mentis with vital signs blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg, pulse rate of 96 beats perminute, respiratory rate of 17 times perminute, and temperature 36°C. His body weight was 58 kg, height 173 cm, BMI of 19.3. His skin was icteric, with icteric sclera and pale conjunctiva.

On admission, his blood pressure was 136/83 mmHg. A physical examination showed bilateral pretibial edema. No abnormal signs were observed in the lungs, heart, or abdomen.\nUrinalysis showed heavy proteinuria (5.1 g/g creatinine) without hematuria. His leukocyte count, hemoglobin level, and platelet count were 5,900/µL, 14.7 g/dL, and 191,000/µL, respectively. Serum total protein was 5.2 g/dL, albumin 2.4 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen 8.4 mg/dL, creatinine 0.79 mg/dL, alanine aminotransferase 16 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 11 U/L, lactate dehydrogenase 206 U/L, total cholesterol 261 mg/dL, IgG 572 mg/dL, IgA 345 mg/dL, IgM 93 mg/dL, C3 80 mg/dL (normal range: 65 – 135 mg/dL), and C4 12 mg/dL (normal range: 13 – 35 mg/dL). Tests for anti-nuclear antibodies, cryoglobulin, hepatitis B virus antigen, and anti-hepatitis C antibodies were all negative. Monoclonal proteins were not detected in the serum or urine. Circulating IgA-class anti-PLA2R antibodies were not determined by our in-house ELISA [] using peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgA as a secondary antibody.\nDue to the presence of NS, a renal biopsy was performed. Light microscopy showed global scleroses in 2 of 20 glomeruli. The functioning glomeruli showed no mesangial proliferation and no bubbling/spike appearance along the glomerular capillary walls (). In the tubulointerstitium, mild lymphocyte infiltration, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis were observed. There was moderate arteriolar hyalinosis. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed 2+ granular staining for IgA- and IgA1-heavy chains (b, c), 2+ granular staining for κ- and λ-light chains (f, g), and trace granular staining for C3 (h) along the glomerular capillary walls, but no significant staining for IgG-, IgA2-, IgM-heavy chains, or C1q (a, d, e, i). An immunofluorescence study using anti-PLA2R antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) showed negative glomerular staining. Electron microscopy revealed extensive foot process effacement of the podocytes, which contained large amounts of dense materials mainly in the area covering the surface of the glomerular basement membrane, but not in the mesangial area (a). Small amounts of electron-dense deposits were observed beneath the cytoplasm of the podocytes containing the dense materials (b). From the above-mentioned pathological findings, the diagnosis of early stage MN with solitary polyclonal IgA deposition was made.\nHe was treated with low-dose prednisolone (PSL) (10 mg/day for 8 weeks) in consideration of his history of type 2 diabetes. Thereafter, partial effects on proteinuria were observed, and PSL doses were gradually tapered. At the 3-year follow-up he was well. His urinary protein was 2.1 g/g creatinine, serum total protein 5.8 g/dL, albumin 3.5 g/dL, and creatinine 0.87 mg/dL. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "Ultrasonographic examination of an asymptomatic 62-year-old woman with chronic HCV genotype 1b infection revealed a hypoechogenic lesion in liver segment III. Active chronic liver disease was diagnosed 12 years previously based on liver biopsy that revealed a grade of 8 and stage 3 according to the Ishak staging system. Results of laboratory investigations were as follows: HCV RNA, 2530000 IU/ml; normal lactate dehydrogenase level (270 U/l [normal, 240–450 U/l]); haemoglobin, 12.9 g/dl; platelet count, 175.000/mm3; white blood cell count, 4900/mm2; aspartate aminotransferase, 40 U/l; alanine aminotransferase, 65 U/l; albumin, 4.1 g/dl and total bilirubin 1.0 mg/dl. Total body computed tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast revealed several nodular liver lesions with early arterial phase enhancement and slow washout with uncertain diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated hyperintensity on post-contrast T1-weighted images of the lesions and isointensity in the T2 phase (). Positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose demonstrated only intense fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in different areas of the liver as a unique localization of the neoplasm. A liver biopsy was prompted by the uncertain behavior of the liver lesions. Microscopic examination of the liver biopsy revealed infiltration of typical centrocyte-like lymphoid cells and lymphoepithelial lesions in these small- to medium-size lymphocytes (). Immunohistochemistry findings were positive for CD20, CD79a and BCL-2, and negative for CD3, CD5, CD10, CD43 and cyclin D1 (). A diagnosis of stage IV liver MZL was made. Bone marrow biopsy did not reveal infiltration of lymphocytes. After haematology consultation, it was decided to administer antiviral therapy with sofosbuvir (NS5B inhibitor) associated with simeprevir (a protease inhibitor) for a duration of 12 weeks. Three months after the conclusion of antiviral treatment, HCV RNA was negative, thus confirming the eradication of HCV infection. MRI performed 6 and 12 months after antiviral therapy demonstrated complete resolution of the liver lesions (). Currently, no liver lesions are apparent on MRI after 3 years of follow-up.

    "question": "A 73-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic alcohol use presented to the emergency department (ED) with fever, melena, and intermittent episodes of confusion. The patient was admitted to the hospital seven weeks prior to this admission for an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. His course was complicated by a right hepatic artery injury treated with ligation and clipping, with subsequent development of multiple hepatic abscesses, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, Enterococcus faecium bacteremia, and a bile leak. The bile leak required treatment with endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy and a common bile duct (CBD) stent placement. The patient was discharged to rehab with a Jackson Pratt (JP) drain (Cardinal Health, Dublin, Ohio) in place. He was continued on daptomycin and ertapenem for four weeks for hepatic abscesses per the infectious disease specialist. The patient returned to the hospital for recurrent fevers and melena. History was limited due to acute delirium but right upper quadrant abdominal pain was noted. He denied bright red blood per rectum, hematemesis, nausea, vomiting, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. His JP drain had a recorded output of approximately 30-40 cc/day.\nThe patient was febrile with a temperature of 101.7 Fahrenheit within a few hours of admission. Other vital signs were significant for sinus tachycardia, with 110 beats per minute, and tachypnea, with 22 breaths per minute. Blood pressure and oxygen saturation were at 154/65 and 100% on room air, respectively. The physical exam was notable for confusion, abdominal tenderness to palpation that was worse in the right upper quadrant, and the JP drain in the right upper quadrant. Laboratory findings on admission were significant for leukocytosis, with a white blood cell (WBC) count of up to 13,200/mm3. His hemoglobin and hematocrit were noted to be at 6.2 gm/dL and 19%, respectively, which was decreased from the hemoglobin of 10.3 gm/dL on the day of his last discharge. Platelets on admission were within normal limits at 213,000/mm3. His comprehensive metabolic panel from admission revealed transaminitis, with an elevated aspartate aminotransferase of 149 U/L, alanine aminotransferase of 134 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase at 51 0U/L. There was no significant elevation of total bilirubin. The patient's prothrombin time was elevated to 16.1 seconds, and the international normalized ratio INR was 1.41 on admission.\nOn day one, the patient became hemodynamically unstable, with worsening mentation, tachycardia, and tachypnea, requiring a transfer to the intensive care unit. Surgery and gastrointestinal medicine were consulted for evaluation. The patient underwent imaging with computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, which revealed persistent postsurgical changes of cholecystectomy and an unchanged common bile duct stent. A right-sided abdominal drain was noted to be in the right upper quadrant. Multilobulated, predominantly hypoattenuating masses were noted throughout the liver, with persistent hyperdensity, more centrally suggestive of combined multifocal hepatic abscess and central hemorrhage, also reported. He was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells (RBCs) and resuscitated with intravenous (IV) lactated ringer fluids. Blood cultures were obtained, and the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics.\nHe was taken for an esophagoduodenoscopy (EGD) to assess for causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). This did not show any evidence of active bleeding or hemobilia at the previous sphincterotomy site; however, the patient had significant melena noted at the end of the exam and was emergently taken for further evaluation with computed tomographic angiography (CTA). CTA revealed transient hyperdensity within the right lobe of the liver, adjacent to the right portal vein, suspicious for a hepatic artery injury/pseudoaneurysm as seen in Figure .\nFigure shows CTA findings of the clipped right hepatic artery from the patient's initial surgery.\nHe was then taken for visceral angiography by interventional radiography (IR), which confirmed a previous iatrogenic hepatic artery ligation and showed an arterial enhancing structure within the central aspect of the liver consistent with a hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm, as seen in Figure and Figure .\nThe patient’s pseudoaneurysm was not amenable to catheter-directed embolization, as there was no direct feeding arterial structure identified. He was subsequently taken to the operating room for a right hepatectomy. Post right hepatectomy, the patient remained tenuous and began to decline quickly after developing acute oliguric renal failure, which required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and resistant hypoglycemia. Additionally, worsening shock required pressure and, ultimately, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). Due to the patient’s acute decompensation and prolonged hospital course, his wife elected to move toward comfort care and withdrawal of aggressive measures.

The patient had undergone right lobectomy of the liver due to HCC at Severance Hospital (Seoul, Korea) on October 23, 2006. At that time, the surgical specimen was confirmed to be HCC, Edmondson grade II. After 14 months, a chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed multiple lung metastases and left adrenal gland metastasis. The level of serum protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II (PIVKA II) was elevated abnormally (207 mAU/ml). Diagnosed with recurrent HCC with multiple lung metastases and adrenal metastasis, the patient received palliative chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, adriamycin and carboplatin. Following two cycles of first-line chemotherapy, the disease progressed. The patient was administered two more cycles of second-line chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, etoposide and carboplatin, and three cycles of third-line chemotherapy with oral capecitabine. However, the disease demonstrated no objective response and further progressed. The patient and physician agreed to discontinue cytotoxic chemotherapy, and the patient was transferred to Dankook University Hospital for paliative care on February 19, 2009.\nThe patient was a chronic hepatitis B virus carrier and an older brother had hepatitis B viral liver cirrhosis. Initial laboratory data from our hospital was as follows: White blood cell count, 4,970 cells/μl; hemoglobin level, 17.2 g/dl; platelet count, 16.4×104 platelets/μl; aspartate aminotransferase : alanine aminotransferase level, 32:41 IU/l; total bilirubin level, 0.97 mg/dl; gamma guanosine triphosphate level, 17 IU/l; alkaline phosphatase level, 89 IU/l; protein : albumin level, 8.4:4.3 g/dl; prothrombin time (international normalized ratio), 13.2 sec (1.14); α-fetoprotein (AFP) level, 16.55 ng/ml (normal range, 0–15 ng/ml); and PIVKA II level, 12,900 mAU/ml (normal range, 0–40 mAU/ml). Hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase chain reaction test results were positive. At the time of admission, a chest radiograph of the patient revealed miliary nodules in the entirety of the lungs. CT scan of the chest and abdominopelvis indicated miliary metastases throughout the lungs, bilateral adrenal metastases and metastatic abdominal lymph nodes (). The patient was observed at regular three-monthly follow-ups. After the first three months, the patient continued to exhibit cough and dyspnea, and there was no definitive interval change of the multiple lung metastases on the chest radiograph. At the second visit on September 14, 2009, the general condition of the patient had improved, and the cough and dyspnea had stopped. A chest radiograph revealed that all metastatic nodules had disappeared (). Serum AFP level had decreased to 1.5 ng/ml. Spontaneous tumor regression of HCC was observed, and whole-body positron emission tomography-CT scan in December, 2009 revealed that all metastatic nodules in the lung, as well as the metastatic lesions of the two adrenal glands and lymph nodes, had disappeared. The patient had taken an alternative herbal medicine for approximately one week, on the recommendation of his family. The herbal medicine was Dendropanax morbifera Leveille, which is a subtropical, broad-leaved evergreen tree belonging to the family Araliaceae ().\nFollow-up CT scans revealed no recurrent lesions, and follow-up chest radiograph also indicated no metastatic lesions. Serum AFP and PIVKA II levels were within the normal range (). The patient is alive without any symptoms or signs as of May 2013. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

Urine microscopy revealed red blood cells of 4-6 high power field (HPF).\nInitial complete blood count revealed a WBC of 20.9 K/UL with 83.2% absolute neutrophils, and hemoglobin and hematocrit level of 21.7 gm/dl and 64.1%, respectively, with a platelet count of 344 K. The patient’s complete metabolic panel was significant for elevated liver enzymes - aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 3,334 U/L (normal range: 15-41 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 850 U/L (normal range: 17-63 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (ALP): 151 U/L (normal range: 38-126 U/L); there was renal insufficiency with a creatinine level of 4.16 mg/dl (normal range: 0.7-1.2 mg/dl), urine nitrogen of 32 mg/dl (normal range: 8-20 mg/dl), and potassium of 7.4 mmol/l (normal range: 3.6-5.1 mmol/L) with high anion gap of 21. An arterial blood gas revealed PH of 7.23, PCO2 of 32 mmHg, HCO3 of 14.9 mmol/L, signifying metabolic acidosis with adequate respiratory compensation. CPK levels were markedly elevated at 100,809 U/L. Initial ECG revealed sinus tachycardia with peaked T wave as seen in Figure .\nThe patient received 2 grams of calcium gluconate infusion for cardiac membrane stabilization. He also received insulin and Kayexalate, which corrected his hyperkalemia. The patient was started on IV fluid (IVF) hydration with strict urine output monitoring. Initial MRI without contrast of spine was performed and was only remarkable for mild spondylosis without spondylolisthesis in the L4-L5 region. Neurology was consulted for a more thorough neurological examination, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and management.\nIn the ICU, the patient’s symptoms started to worsen and he reported progression of the numbness up to the knee in both lower limbs. He also complained of worsening pain and weakness in the right lower extremity. During the ICU stay, the right thigh became more swollen compared to the left. Urgent CT scan of the right lower extremity revealed right leg edema without focal tissue or osseous abnormality, as seen in Video .\nDoppler ultrasound showed normal arterial flow and no evidence of deep vein thrombosis. The patient started experiencing new-onset right lower extremity weakness. Dorsal pedis and tibial pedis pulses were present bilaterally. At this juncture, there were concerns for acute compartment syndrome. The patient was placed on neurovascular checks every hour. Intracompartmental pressures were measured frequently, which remained low. Also, surgery was consulted for possible fasciotomy.\nDespite aggressive IVF hydration, the patient’s CPK levels continued to rise. CPK levels peaked at 237,025U/L, even though his hemoconcentration had resolved. Creatinine levels continued to increase, and the patient became anuric and IVF hydration was discontinued. Vascular surgery and nephrology were consulted for emergent Uldall catheter placement and urgent hemodialysis, respectively.\nFollowing repeat sessions of hemodialysis, the patient's renal function improved and CPK levels declined. His lower extremity weakness also started to improve. There was a significant improvement in his left lower extremity numbness. The right leg swelling resolved; however, there was only a mild improvement of motor and sensory loss. The patient continued to undergo physical therapy during his hospitalization. He was subsequently discharged to subacute rehabilitation. The patient was advised to continue with outpatient hemodialysis till full recovery of his renal function was achieved. He was also recommended to follow up with neurology as an outpatient. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

The patient had been well until two weeks earlier, when symptoms developed. She was a farmer in a village and owned a lot of sheep. There were no allergies and no history of recent use of drugs but she was consuming a large amount of nonpasteurized traditional cheese.\nOn physical examination, the patient was nonedematous. Her temperature was 38.5°C, with a blood pressure of 70/45 mm Hg, a pulse rate of 70 beats per minute, and respirations of 18 per minute. The oxygen saturation was 96 percent while she was breathing room air.\nThe liver edge was palpable 5 cm below the costovertebral margin. Her right upper quadrant of abdomen was diffusely tender to palpation. Additionally, there was marginal splenomegaly. The heart sounds and the results of the remainder of the examination were normal.\nLaboratory studies performed at admission revealed a WBC count of 5400 cells/mm³, a hemoglobin level of 10.6 g/dL, a platelet count of 216.000 platelets/mm³, an aspartate aminotransferase level of 224 U/L, an alanine aminostransferase of 159 U/L, an alkaline phosphatase level of 2340 U/L, a gamma glutamyl transferase level of 597 U/L, a direct bilirubin level of 3.1 mg/dL, an albumin level of 3.3 g/dL, a globulin level of 4.3 g/dL and a uric acid level of 1.4 g/dL. Serum pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal function tests were in normal ranges.\nHer other laboratory parameters included erythrocyte sedimentation rate 47 mm/hr, C-Reactive Protein level 26 U/L, serum sodium level 124 mmol/L, potassium 4.4 mmol/L, chloride 95 mmol/L, and plasma osmolality 262 mmol/kg/H2O. Urine biochemistry showed osmolality 274 mmol/kg/H2O and urinary sodium 64 mmol/L. Serologic tests for Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and hepatitis viruses were negative. Electrocardiographic examination showed minimal ST-T elevations.\nUltrasonography and Computed Tomography scan (CT scan) of the abdomen showed a small pericardial effusion with mild splenomegaly and hepatomegaly (Figures and ). However, there was no evidence of biliary dilatation or cholecystitis. CT scan of thorax and brain revealed no abnormality. Echocardiography detected mild pericardial effusion without cardiac dysfunction.\nAt the next day, serum agglutination test for Brucella was positive and its titer was 1/1240. The diagnosis of SIADH in association with cholestatic hepatitis and pericardial effusion due to Brucellosis was made. After intramuscular streptomycin (1000 mg/day for 20 days) with oral Doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for 6 weeks), the patient's symptoms, cholestasis, pericardial effusion, and hyponatremia resolved dramatically.

She was referred to our hospital in November 2015 presenting nausea, vomiting, black stools, and diffuse and sporadic epigastric pain; she also lost 4 kg in 4 months, from 65 to 61 kg, which means a total of 7% weight loss, and showed signs of digestive tract bleeding and anemic syndrome. Serological studies, prior to hospital arrival, showed hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL.\nInitial laboratory results included leukocytes 8,260 μ/L, hemoglobin 10.56 g/dL, platelets 222,000 μ/L, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase 22 μ/L, lactate dehydrogenase 207 μ/L, alkaline phosphatase 71 μ/L, AST 15 μ/L, ALT 13 μ/L, prothrombin time 6.7 s, serum albumin 3.5 g/dL, glucose 185 mg/dL, urea 26.9 mg/dL, creatinine 0.5 mg/dL, and serum carcinoembryonic antigen was elevated to 114.56 UI.\nThe approach protocol started with panendoscopy, showing body and fundus gastropathy and presence of Helicobacter pylori. Four months later, a colonoscopy was performed which revealed a right colonic tumor.\nAn abdominal CT scan followed, which revealed the following: liver with hypodense tumor, with regular edges, in segment V, 24 × 22 × 16 mm, and longitudinal thickening of 82 mm with a reduction of 100% of the intestinal lumen (Fig. ). PET CT showed a nodular lesion of 25 × 21 mm in segment V with maximum SUV of 17.1, a poorly defined lesion in segment VI of 11 mm in diameter, and maximum SUV of 6; ascending colon of 45 cm3 with maximum SUV of 51.4 (Fig. ).\nAn open surgical procedure was performed in May 2016 with right hemicolectomy with ileorectal mechanical anastomosis and hepatic bisegmentectomy V and VI (Fig. ). The duration of the surgical procedure was 4 h, with a 6 h anesthetic time, and total estimated bleeding was 900 mL. The oral feeding started 24 h after the procedure, presenting intestinal gas release at 24 h and evacuations at 48 h. Total intrahospital stay was 5 days, presenting right axillary vein thrombosis due to placement of central venous catheter guided by interventional radiology.\nThe histological diagnosis was moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, intestinal type, with cecum, ascending colon, and appendicular involvement; free surgical margins (R0), nodules 2/11; hepatic lesions with neoplastic cells (Fig. ).\nThe postoperative stay was uneventful while the patient received chemotherapy with capecitabine and oxaliplatin.

She had ingested approximate 14 g/day of alcohol for 20 years. She was acutely ill-looking and had an alert mental status. Upon admission, her vital signs included a blood pressure of 132/80 mmHg, pulse of 76/min, respiratory rate of 20/min, and body temperature of 36.8°C. Decreased breathing sounds and dullness to percussion were evident over the lower one-third of the right hemithorax. No friction rub was auscultated. Heart sounds were regular and there was no murmur. The liver and spleen were not palpated. Palmar erythema, vascular spider, and peripheral edema were absent.\nInitial laboratory data revealed albumin 3.2 g/dL, total protein 6.4 g/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 229 IU/L, aspartate transaminase/alanine aminotransferase of 33/24 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase of 801 IU/L, total bilirubin of 0.6 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine of 12.5/0.89 mg/dL, white blood cell (WBC) count of 3430/mm3, hematocrit of 38.4%, platelet count of 150,000/mm3, prothrombin time (international normalized ratio) of 1.08, C-reactive protein of 0.07 mg/dL, and blood analysis of N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide of 257 ng/mL. Urinalysis revealed no proteinuria. Hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody were not detected.\nChest X-ray showed a significant right-sided pleural effusion. A thoracentesis was performed and 1500 mL of the pleural effusion was drained. The pleural fluid was yellowish, and an analysis revealed a pH of 7.3, glucose of 212 mg/dL, LDH of 105 IU/L, protein of 3.0 g/dL, red blood cell count of 330/mm3, WBC count of 1/mm3, adenosine deaminase of 11.9 IU/L, and carcinoembryonic antigen of 2.5 mg/mL. Pleural fluid was transudate. Culture for bacteria as well as an acid-fast bacillus smear and culture were negative. No malignant cells were observed.\nA chest computed tomography scan revealed no parenchymal lung disease or pleural thickening. On abdominal ultrasonography, the liver size and contour were within the normal range without evidence of ascites, but the liver parenchymal echogenicity was slightly increased, which was suggestive of fatty liver. We also performed an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which revealed gastric erosion but no esophageal varices. Echocardiography revealed no evidence of cardiac disease.\nWe repeated the thoracentesis every 3 days for 2 weeks and empirically prescribed diuretics. The collected fluids were also transudate, but the right-sided pleural effusion was not improved.\nAlthough laboratory findings and abdominal ultrasonography did not show the evidence of liver cirrhosis, due to her alcoholic history, we performed an examination using a transient elastography, which can measure liver stiffness. The transient elastography result was 35.3 Kpa, which was suggestive of liver cirrhosis. Accordingly, we suspected a hepatic hydrothorax in the absence of ascites. A radioisotope 99mTc-sulfur colloid injected in peritoneal cavity resulted in a positive uptake of radioactivity within the right pleural cavity (Fig. \n). This finding suggested that the pleural effusion originated in the peritoneal cavity and that there was a diaphragmatic defect.\nWe diagnosed the patient as having hepatic hydrothorax without ascites, which was the first sign of alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Once the patient was started on a strict low salt diet and a water restriction with diuretics, the pleural effusion slowly regressed. After 2 months of treatment, the hydrothorax was resolved.

She presented to her next appointment eight days later with complaints of fevers with chills, night sweats, lethargy, headaches, myalgias, nausea, anorexia, left-sided pleuritic chest pain and multiple episodes of watery, non-bloody diarrhea. She was directed to the emergency department for further evaluation.\nShe denied sick contacts, recent travel, medication changes or medication non-compliance. At the time of admission, she was on prednisone 5 mg PO (oral) QD, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 360 mg PO QID, tacrolimus 0.5 mg PO BID.\nHer vitals on admission were significant for temperature 101.7 F, heart rate 100/minute, blood pressure 118/79 mm Hg, respirations 18/minute and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Physical exam revealed no acute abnormalities.\nAdmission labs were significant for white blood cell (WBC) 2,070/mm3 [normal range (N): 3,800-10,500/mm3], absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 1,865/mm3 [N: 1,800-7,400/mm3], lymphocyte count 500/mm3 [N: 1,000-3,300/mm3], platelets 108,000/mm3 [N: 150,000-400,00/mm3], aspartate transaminase (AST) 81 U/l [N: 10-40 U/l], alanine transaminase (ALT) 87 U/l [N: 10-45 U/l], alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 137 U/l [N: 40-120 U/l] and normal renal function. Electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm with no acute changes. Chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) ruled out the presence of pneumonia. Abdominal ultrasound showed polycystic liver and kidneys, contracted gallbladder with negative sonographic Murphy’s sign. CT of the abdomen and pelvis confirmed polycystic liver and kidneys, as well as mural thickening of ascending colon with mild surrounding inflammatory changes (suggestive of colitis) (Figures , ).\nUrinalysis was not suggestive of infection. Respiratory viral panel multiplex test was negative. Clostridium difficile toxin test was negative. Stool cultures were negative. Stool microscopy was negative for ova and parasites. Urine cultures revealed Escherichia coli (10,000-49,000 CFU/ml) combined with normal urogenital flora. Blood cultures revealed no growth. Testing for acute hepatitis A, B and C viruses was negative. Epstein-Barr virus serology revealed prior infection. BK virus DNA, Parvovirus B19 DNA and adenovirus DNA were not detected by specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests.\nInfectious diseases service was consulted. Given the presence of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, transaminitis and multi-systemic symptoms, there was concern for an ongoing viral process. She was started on valganciclovir 900 mg PO BID for presumed CMV disease, with intravenous fluid support. The E. coli in the urine was thought to be a colonization and she was successfully monitored off antibiotics.\nShe continued to have persistent fevers and diarrhea, with worsening leukopenia (lowest WBC count 1700/mm3 with lowest ANC 800/mm3), thrombocytopenia (nadir 86,000/mm3) and liver function abnormalities (AST 139 U/l, ALT 135 U/l, ALP 167 U/l). Given the persistent symptoms and worsening laboratory parameters, MMF was discontinued. Serum CMV PCR testing revealed 154,697 IU/ml (5.19 log10 IU/ml) [lower limit of assay detection 60 IU/ml (1.78 log10 IU/ml)]. Gastroenterology service was consulted for worsening liver function abnormalities and they attributed the clinical picture to systemic CMV infection.\nShe had clinical improvement, with improving CMV PCR tests [504 IU/ml (2.70 log10 IU/ml)] after 12 days of antiviral therapy. She was discharged on the twelfth day of hospital stay, with recovery of WBC count to 5,600/mm3 and platelets 147,000/mm3.\nShe was followed up by in the outpatient transplant nephrology and infectious diseases clinics. CMV PCR was negative 60 days after initiation of antiviral therapy and she was restarted on a lower dose of MMF.

He denied any fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, melena, hematochezia, or acholic stools. Past medical history was significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease stage IV. He reported recent loss of appetite but denied any significant weight changes. Ultrasound ordered by primary care physician showed intra- and extra-hepatic biliary dilation with distension of gall bladder without cholelithiasis. He was sent to the emergency department (ED) for further evaluation.\nOn examination, blood pressure was 133/60 mmHg, heart rate was 75 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 23 breaths per minute, temperature was 97.7°F, and oxygen saturation was 98% in room air. He had mild icteric sclera, and chronic venous stasis changes in bilateral lower extremities were noted. Bowel sounds were normal, and no hepatosplenomegaly or abdominal tenderness was noted on exam.\nLaboratory investigations showed a hemoglobin count of 11 g/dl, white blood cell count of (WBC) 3800 cell/mm3, and platelet count of 214,000/mm3. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were elevated at 326 and 321 IU/L, respectively. Total bilirubin was 3.1 mg/dl with direct bilirubin of 1.8 mg/dl. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was 1,219 IU/L with lipase 250 IU/L. Renal function tests were at baseline at 1.72 mg/dl (baseline 1.7–1.9 mg/dl). Recent upper and lower endoscopy (1 month earlier) did not show significant abnormalities, except for mild antral gastropathy. A computed tomography (CT) scan of abdomen and pelvis revealed stable pelvic adenopathy with largest lymph node measuring 4.4 × 1.7 cm (which was noted on the earlier CT scan as well). The pancreatic tissue and abdominal vessels appeared normal. With concern for underlying malignancy, a lymph node biopsy was performed. Endoscopic retrograde of cholangiopancreatography revealed distal common bile duct stricture of 3 cm without obstruction, for which a biliary stent was placed. No pancreatic lesions were observed, and biliary brushings were negative for malignancy.\nThe patient returned to the ED two months later; this time with a fever (102°F), nausea, and right upper quadrant pain for 2 days. Complete blood counts revealed elevated white cell count of 18,700/mm3. AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels were within normal limits, and ALP was elevated at 127 IU/L. The CT scan of abdomen revealed intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and gall bladder wall thickening with pericholecystic inflammatory stranding with normal pancreas (). He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics with piperacillin-tazobactam. Urgent surgical decompression with percutaneous drain placement was performed for stent blockage (with re-stent placement) and bile duct stricture from unknown etiology.\nMeanwhile, histopathology from the earlier right iliac lymph node biopsy revealed sinus histiocytic aggregates interlaced with lymphocytes and plasma cells (), majority of cellular constituents being plasma cells, characterized by oval cellular contours and eccentrically located nuclei (); this was confirmed by diffuse immunoreactivity for CD138 (). Chromogenic in situ hybridization for kappa light chain () and lambda light chain () showed a mixture of kappa and lambda-bearing cells (approximate kappa to lambda ratio of 3 : 1); this finding suggested that the plasma cells were reactive in nature, arguing against the possibility of a plasma cell neoplasm. In situ hybridization for EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) was interpreted as negative.\nAs there was no evidence to suggest a lymphoma or a plasma cell neoplasm, a diagnosis of IgG-related disease was considered. Additional immunohistochemistry showed that the plasma cells present expressed predominantly IgG (); of these, the majority (over 60%) were reactive for IgG4 (). Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation showed polyclonal increase in IgG with no monoclonal proteins. Serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G levels were high (3390 mg/dl) with normal IgA and IgM. IgG subclasses were also high with IgG1 of 1800, IgG2 975, IgG3 324, and IgG4 729 mg/dl.\nA diagnosis of IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis was made, and he was started on prednisone 40 mg daily for 6 weeks. A follow-up CT scan of abdomen after a month revealed significant reduction in the size of his pelvic lymph nodes with largest lymph node measuring 1.8 × 0.7 cm (). Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) performed revealed resolution of stricture (). The biliary stent was removed following resolution of the stricture. He remains on prednisone 20 mg daily with close rheumatology follow-up. Rituximab therapy is being considered as a steroid-sparing agent. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

Liver function test (LFT) showed total bilirubin 66 μmol/L, direct bilirubin 7 μmol/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 23 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 38 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 161 U/L. His lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was elevated to 1450 U/L. Direct Coombs test was positive for antibodies against red blood cells.\nSerologies were negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus. Serological evaluation for antinuclear antibody (ANA), antidouble-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid antibody (ds-DNA), and anti–smooth muscle antibody (ASMA) were negative. Immunoglobulin levels were normal. A presumptive diagnosis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia was made, and the patient was started on oral prednisone 60 mg daily.\nDue to the presenting complaint of melena, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was done, which revealed a peptic ulcer in the first part of the duodenum. A tissue sample was taken during endoscopy, which did not reveal Helicobacter pylori. He was treated with proton pump inhibitors for his peptic ulcer disease.\nMeanwhile, a chest X-ray showed right-sided pleural effusion (Figure ). The pleural fluid analysis showed an exudative pleural effusion with lymphocyte predominance, lymphocyte to neutrophil ratio of 4, and high adenosine deaminase activity (89 units/L). Computed tomography scan (CT) of the chest with and without contrast showed multiple centriacinar nodules giving tree in bud appearance, fibrotic changes in the right upper lobe, and moderate right-sided pleural effusion suggestive of tubercular pathology. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) was not visualized in the microscopic analysis of the sputum. However, due to high clinical suspicion, corroborative pleural fluid analysis and chest imaging findings, he was started on antitubercular treatment with isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.\nFollow-up laboratories showed Hb stable at 5-7 g/dL. Platelet count decreased to 127 000/mm3 at the time of discharge (Figure ). Following discharge on antitubercular medications and prednisone, he was lost to follow up.\nThe patient presented to our clinic after 3 months following an exacerbation of his symptoms after the inadvertent stopping of his prednisone. He presented with increased fatigue, generalized weakness, and jaundice. He had no preceding upper respiratory tract symptoms. Blood investigation this time showed Hb: 4 g/dL, WBC: 6500/mm3, and platelets: 10 000/mm3. LFT showed total bilirubin: 48.05 μmol/L and direct bilirubin: 13.51 μmol/L. LDH was elevated to 851 U/L.\nThe development of thrombocytopenia in a patient with pre-existing autoimmune hemolytic anemia led us to consider the possibility of Evans syndrome as the cause of bicytopenia. He was started on intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g once daily for 3 days, followed by oral prednisone 60 mg daily. However, there was no improvement in his Hb or platelet count. We considered other immunosuppressive therapies like intravenous immunoglobulin, rituximab, and cyclosporine as possible treatment options, but we faced two challenges with their use: fear of reactivation of TB and the prohibitive cost. Eventually, we decided to start him on cyclosporine, given its affordable cost despite the risk of reactivation of TB. He was discharged on oral cyclosporine 10 mg daily for a month. Unfortunately, he was again lost to follow up. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 69-year-old man presented with general malaise, anorexia, and a history of daily alcohol consumption;he was admitted to Hanawa Kousei Hospital. There was no pertinent history pertaining to medical treatment, family, medication, blood transfusion, or allergy. He had been drinking approximately 900 mL of sake daily for the past 49 years, and had a 29 pack-year smoking history. He had bowel movements once or twice daily with no history of habitual laxative use or enemas. On physical examination, he was lucid, had a heart rate of 84/min, blood pressure of 138/66 mm Hg, and a temperature of 36.9°C;there was jaundice and hepatomegaly. Laboratory findings included white blood cells 9,100/μL, red blood cells 366×10\n4/μL, hemoglobin 12.9 g/dL, platelets 15.1×10\n4/μL, total protein 5.4 g/dL, albumin 2.3 g/dL, total bilirubin 5.85 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 4.02 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 185 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 182 U/L, lactate dehydrogenase 526 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 1,312 U/L, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase 1.782 U/L, amylase 42 U/L, blood urea nitrogen 29.4 mg/dL, serum creatinine 1.54 mg/dL, C-reactive protein 6.31 mg/dL, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) 9.7 ng/mL, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) 54 U/mL, and soluble interleukin-2 receptor 510 U/mL. Hepatitis virus markers and autoantibodies were negative. Urine was positive for ketone bodies. A non-contrast CT confirmed hepatomegaly, with no evidence of bile duct obstruction or malignant tumor (). In addition, CT showed localized colonic wall-thickening at the splenic flexure (). We diagnosed the patient as having acute alcoholic hepatitis in light of his drinking history. He had avoided medical checkups previously; on the other hand, he had no other conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, or hyperuricemia, after admission. His clinical symptoms, jaundice, and liver dysfunction rapidly improved with fluid replacement and rest. Non-contrast CT on admission showed colonic wall-thickening at the splenic flexure, and a blood test showed a slight increase in CEA. Since the patient had not previously undergone CS, it was performed to rule out colon cancer on the seventh hospital day. The colonic splenic flexure showed redness over two-thirds of its circumference and an ulcerative, slightly constricted lesion approximately 5 cm in length (). Differential diagnosis included IC, colon cancer, malignant lymphoma, infectious enteritis, and inflammatory bowel disease, but the histopathological findings on biopsy showed only nonspecific inflammatory changes. On the 12th hospital day, contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen revealed a thickened colonic splenic flexure wall. There was no enhancement of the intestinal wall (). Although calcification of the aorta was observed, there was no evidence of calcification or occlusion in the superior mesenteric artery, inferior mesenteric artery, superior mesenteric vein, inferior mesenteric vein, branches, or portal vein. The patient had constipation after initiation of conservative treatment, and malignancy could not be ruled out from the findings of contrast-enhanced CT. On day 30 after starting treatment, a second CS revealed complete circumferential stenosis of the colonic splenic flexure with difficulty in passing the scope through the proximal side (). With gastrografin contrast radiography through CS, full-circumference stenosis to approximately 3 cm was recognized (). Stricture-type IC was suspected based on the first endoscopy and rapid course of circumferential stenosis. Histopathological findings on biopsy showed erosion of the mucosa, edema of the stroma, and infiltration of inflammatory cells, confirming the diagnosis of IC (). Surgery was also considered, but the patient had only mild symptoms of constipation, which were judged not to be indicative of complete intestinal obstruction. Therefore, conservative treatment with oral laxatives and intestinal motion regulators was performed. CEA decreased to 6.0 ng/mL on the 56th hospital day. CS showed scarring and healing of the lesion on the 105th hospital day (), and histopathological findings on biopsy showed no evidence of malignancy. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

She also reported few days of nausea and vomiting associated with worsening ascites. She denied any significant past medical history except for a ruptured ovarian cyst at age of 30 years that required emergent surgery. Patient had a long history of alcohol use (two glasses of vodka daily) for over 10 years. Physical exam showed scleral icterus, there was mild abdominal distention with epigastric tenderness, no hepatosplenomegaly was noted. No signs of encephalopathy or asterixis were seen. Blood test showed hemoglobin 10.4 × 10 g/dL, white blood cell count of 7.7 × 103 cells/µL and platelet count of 190 × 103 cells/µL. Her prothrombin time and international normalized ratio (INR) were elevated at 1.4 and 14.3 s, respectively. Liver function test showed aspartate transaminase 140 U/L, alanine transaminase 29 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 332 U/L, total bilirubin 9.6 mg/dL (direct 7.4 mg/dL, indirect 2.2 mg/dL). Few hours after admission, she developed an episode of hematemesis with drop in hemoglobin to 7.7 g/dL. Emergent endoscopy showed a non-bleeding 2 cm prepyloric gastric antral ulcer (). Biopsy of the ulcer base was negative for malignancy or H. pylori.\nFollow-up endoscopy at an interval of 6 weeks showed a healing prepyloric antral ulcer with mild portal hypertensive gastropathy (). Patient had a repeat endoscopy at 4 months for persistent nausea and vomiting which again showed a healing antral ulcer. She continued to drink alcohol and was intermittently followed by her the primary care physician. She also reported daily NSAID use for abdominal pain and nausea. She had multiple emergency department (ED) visits for the same complaints and underwent repeat endoscopy which showed a duodenal ulcer (). She was managed with pantoprazole twice daily and was advised to avoid NSAIDs and alcohol. She also underwent extensive workup for recurrent nausea and vomiting which were all unremarkable. Systemic disorders including but not limited to neurological cause, adrenal, parathyroid and diabetes were also ruled out.\nShe again presented to the ED for worsening nausea and vomiting associated with upper abdominal pain. Endoscopy, now 7 years from the discovery of the initial lesion, showed a GDF. The prepyloric antral ulcer had fistulized into the duodenal bulb creating the appearance of a double pylorus (). Biopsy of the ulcer base was again negative for malignancy or H. pylori. H. pylori stool antigen and serum H. pylori antibody test were also negative. She was discharged on oral proton pump inhibitor and has been followed up with gastroenterology for management of Laennec’s cirrhosis.

    "question": "A 67-year-old man was referred for biopsy of a known retroperitoneal mass in April 2006 after suddenly developing gross hematuria two months earlier. The patient was diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis at a hospital three years previous on the basis of profound hypothyroidism, markedly increased levels of autoimmune antibody (thyroglobulin antibody 1,587.2 U/mL, normal values: 0 - 60 U/mL; microsomal antibody > 3,000 U/mL, normal values: 0 - 60 U/mL), and a diffuse hypoechogenic ultrasonographic pattern. Upon referral in April of 2006, he had been taking levothyroxine to control his Hashimoto's. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis at a previous hospital revealed a retroperitoneal soft tissue mass extending from the lower pole of the kidney to the iliac chains, inducing bilateral ureteral obstruction. The CT did not demonstrate soft tissue between the aorta and vertebra or lymphadenopathy, excluding malignancy. A right percutaneous nephrostomy was also performed at the previous hospital in order to decompress hydronephrosis due to the retroperitoneal mass.\nOn admission, the patient's blood pressure was 140/100 mmHg and body temperature was 36.5℃. The lungs were clear to auscultation, heart sounds were within normal limits, and the abdomen was soft with no masses or tenderness. There was no lower extremity edema observed and the thyroid gland was not enlarged. Results of the complete blood count, electrolytes, creatinine, urea nitrogen, protein, albumin, bilirubin, β2-microglobulin and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were within normal ranges. Upon immunological testing, immunoglobulin G, C3 and C4 levels remained within normal ranges. No cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody or cryoglobulin was detected, and antinuclear antibodies and anti-DNA antibodies were negative. The patient showed signs of hypothyroidism with an elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) (69.56 µIU/mL, normal values: 0.4 - 3.1 µIU/mL) and reduced free T4 (0.83 ng/dL, normal values: 0.73 - 1.95 ng/dL). Upon autoantibody screening, the thyroglobulin (1,368.7 U/mL, normal values: 0 - 60 U/mL) and microsomal antibodies were elevated (> 3,000 U/mL, normal values: 0 - 60 U/mL) despite good medication compliance. After initiating an increased dose of levothyroxine (0.2 mg), laparoscopic biopsy of the retroperitoneal mass was performed.\nMicroscopically, the mass was ill-defined and composed predominantly of chronic inflammation and fibrosis. The inflammatory cells were mainly lymphocytes and plasma cells with the occasional formation of lymphoid follicles (). Based on pathologic diagnosis, the patient was started on deflazacort 72 mg daily. The patient was discharged after 13 days of hospitalization and continued to receive steroid therapy at the outpatient clinic. Normal thyroid function was achieved after two months of steroid treatment; therefore levothyroxine therapy was withdrawn. Steroids were tapered to 6 mg after two months, which is the patient's current dose. The patient experienced no side effects during steroid treatment. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated marked reduction of the retroperitoneal mass and no sign of hydronephrotic change in either kidney. Moreover, an abdominal-pelvic CT scan performed nine months after steroid treatment showed reduced mass lesion in the retroperitoneal space with resolved right side hydronephrosis ().

    "question": "A 22-month-old African-American girl was transferred from an outside hospital to the intensive care unit for further evaluation and the management of uncontrolled severe hypertension. She had a three-day history of fever, cough, rhinorrhea, shortness of breath, dizziness and vomiting. She was born at term with a weight of 2.8 kg and had an unremarkable perinatal course. She had no known genetic syndromes. Besides a history of difficulty gaining weight with a current weight of 10.7 kg (seventh percentile) and a height of the 25th centile, she had no other known medical problems in the past. There was no history of urinary tract infections or blood in urine. She did not have headaches, seizures or fainting episodes. Immunizations were up-to-date. Prior blood pressure (BP) measurements were unknown because they were never obtained. There were no other past hospitalizations. She had not been taking any medications. Family history was unremarkable for kidney disease, hypertension, dialysis or transplantation.\nUpon physical examination, her vital signs were as follows: a temperature of 36.9 °C (98 °F), a respiratory rate of 16 per minute, a heart rate of 145 beats per minute, an oxygen saturation of 100% on room air, and an elevated BP of 200/120 mm Hg (manual, right upper extremity, proper size cuff; 95th percentile value for her age, gender and height 104/62 mm Hg). The examination showed a thin-appearing toddler who was not in obvious distress. The rest of the examination was negative except for tachycardia and a grade II/VI systolic murmur at the apex. A renal bruit was not heard upon auscultation. There was no skin rash or edema. The neurologic examination was normal.\nThe nasal swab for a respiratory viral panel test was positive for parainfluenza 3. Besides mild nasal congestion, she had no cough, difficulty breathing, or wheezing, and she remained stable in room air. She remained afebrile throughout the hospital admission. Her throat culture was negative for beta-hemolytic streptococcus. Her blood culture showed no growth. Her chest x-ray showed mild cardiomegaly but no focal airspace disease, pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Her electrocardiogram showed supraventricular tachycardia. Her echocardiogram revealed a dilated left ventricle with severe concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, with an LV mass index of 187 gm/m2.7 and a mildly depressed LV systolic function with an ejection fraction of 50%. There was a thrombus in the apex of the LV. The serum brain natriuretic peptide and troponin I levels were 1565 pg/mL (normal: <100 pg/mL) and 242 pg/mL (normal: <15 pg/mL), respectively. For possible viral-induced cardiomyopathy, she was started on intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone. For hypertension, she was started on nicardipine infusion, along with nitroprusside with a goal BP reduction of 30% over 24 hours. Milrinone was added for depressed LV systolic function. She remained on the maximum nicardipine infusion rate for several days due to persistent hypertension, with systolic BPs of 140–150 mm Hg. Heparin was transitioned to enoxaparin and aspirin, with the resolution of the cardiac thrombus by day three. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of head showed no mass, acute intracranial hemorrhage, cytotoxic edema, midline shift, or signs of herniation. Her urine output was normal.\nA renal function test showed an initial serum sodium level of 131 meq/L with a nadir of 121 meq/L at day three of admission, a serum chloride level of 97 meq/L (nadir 84 meq/L at day three), a serum potassium level of 3.2 meq/L, a blood urea nitrogen level of 25 mg/dL, and a serum creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL. Her fasting blood glucose level was 90 mg/dL. Her urine sodium level was 89 mmol/L with a fractional excretion of sodium of 1.5%. Her serum albumin level was between 2.1 and 2.5 gm/dL, and her random urine protein to creatinine ratio was 4.6 (normal: <0.2). There was no microscopic hematuria. Her urine culture showed no growth. Her blood counts and serum complements were both normal. Her sickle cell screen was negative. A renal sonogram showed a small right kidney of 6 cm in length (36th centile) and a left kidney of 7.7 cm in length (96th centile), with good blood flow in both kidneys. Her serum aldosterone and plasma renin activity at the time of admission were both elevated at 106 ng/dL (normal: <16 ng/dL, supine, quantitative chemiluminescent immunoassay) and >150 ng/mL/h, respectively (normal: 1.7–11.2 ng/mL/h, supine, quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; both ARUP laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT, USA).\nA work-up for possible catecholamine-secreting tumors due to severe hypertension included the evaluation of urine and serum catecholamines. Her 24-hour urine normetanephrine, metanephrine, vanillylmandelic acid, and homovanillic acid levels were 1525 µg/g of creatinine (normal: 0–1300 µg/g of creatinine), 433 µg/g of creatinine (normal: 0–530 µg/g of creatinine), 10 mg/g of creatinine (normal: <16 mg/g of creatinine), and 12 mg/g of creatinine (normal: <25 mg/g of creatinine), respectively. Her serum fractionated catecholamines showed the following: an epinephrine level of 152 pg/mL (normal: 36–640 pg/mL) and a norepinephrine level of 1964 pg/mL (normal: 68–1810 pg/ml), respectively. Given a less than two-fold increase from normal range of serum norepinephrine, the suspicion of the presence of a neuroendocrine tumor was low.\nA diuretic nuclear renogram showed asymmetrical renal function with decreased blood flow and function in the small right kidney relative to the left. Her differential function was 70% in the left and 30% in the right. There was a normal uptake of the technetium-99 m MAG3 (mercaptoacetyltriglycine) with prompt excretion from the left kidney. Her right kidney had little delayed uptake with prompt excretion ( and , ). A duplex sonogram of her RA showed focal elevation in velocity in the proximal right main RA (peak systolic velocity (PSV): 405 cm/second) with a decreased velocity in the mid and distal RAs (PSV: 117 and 110 cm/sec, respectively). The renal aortic ratio (RAR, the ratio of renal to aortic PSV) was elevated at 3.2. Additionally, distinct “tardus-parvus” (tardus-slow and late, parvus-small and little) waveforms were seen at the right hilar and interlobar arteries. This combination of an elevated PSV at the proximal right main RA along with an elevated RAR (usual cut-off 3) and abnormal waveforms was highly suggestive of proximal right main RAS. Velocities in the left main RA were normal with no differences at various segments of the main artery. A CT angiogram (CTA) of the RAs showed a small right kidney of 6 cm in length with a decreased enhancement of the superior pole of the right kidney. The origin of the right main RA was diminutive compared to the left. There was a homogenous enhancement of the left kidney with a normal appearing left RA. Hypertension at that time was well controlled with amlodipine, clonidine, furosemide, spironolactone and labetalol. Nicardipine infusion was discontinued at day seven of admission.\nA few days later, she underwent a digital subtraction angiogram (DSA), which showed a beaded appearance of the right proximal main RA, which caused a focal stenosis with post-stenotic dilatation ( and ). The pressure gradient across the stenotic lesion was 40 mm Hg. There was normal renal parenchymal perfusion. The left RA demonstrated a normal appearance of the main and branch arteries with normal renal parenchymal perfusion and no evidence of stenosis and irregularity. A diagnosis of right RA stenosis, most likely due to focal FMD, was made. In conjunction with vascular surgery and intervention radiology, it was collectively decided not to pursue the intervention of the stenotic lesion due to the risk of complication, specifically the injury or dissection of the right RA, especially because her BPs were relatively controlled on five antihypertensive agents. Subsequent to the angiogram, enalapril was added once bilateral RA stenosis was excluded for optimal BP control. A CTA of the head and neck vessels to look for evidence of FMD in the head and neck showed a normal vasculature of the vessels. Baby aspirin was started to prevent thromboembolic events.\nThough fever, parainfluenza virus infection, and LV thrombus could have partly contributed to the elevated BPs initially, these signs and symptoms had resolved at the time of or soon after admission. Additionally, the finding of a discrete anatomic lesion in the right RA that is known to cause hypertension suggests that the right RA FMD indeed was the most probable cause of the severe, long-standing hypertension, as suggested by the severe concentric LV hypertrophy. At the time of discharge two weeks later, her BPs were relatively optimal (105–110 mm Hg SBPs) on enalapril, amlodipine and labetalol. Subsequent monthly clinic follow-up visits seven months later have shown stable SBPs with no clinical symptoms of hypertension. Her renal function has remained stable with normal serum electrolytes without hyponatremia and hypokalemia. Her proteinuria has resolved. A follow-up echocardiogram showed normal LV systolic function and stable but persistent LV hypertrophy with no reappearance of the thrombus that was seen in the first echocardiogram. For now, we plan to closely follow-her BPs, along with a follow-up diuretic renogram and a DSA in a few months, with a tentative plan for either continued medical treatment or surgical intervention (angioplasty with or without stent and surgical revascularization or right nephrectomy) based on the clinical course.

She decided to present to the office for further evaluation due to concerns about possible tuberculosis reactivation.\nHer initial vital signs on presentation were as follows: blood pressure 116/59 mmHg, heart rate 81 beats per minute, temperature 97.8°F, body mass index 20.97. Physical examination was completely benign. There was a low clinical suspicion of active tuberculosis given her overall clinical impression. She was recommended to follow up in the clinic in a few weeks after obtaining a two-view chest x-ray (CXR), sputum acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear, and culture. The patient was followed up via telemedicine over the next few weeks. She continued to have a mild cough with a low clinical suspicion for tuberculosis. The AFB smear and culture could not have been completed due to a lack of sputum samples. CXR revealed small rim calcified lesions in the right mid and upper lung zones suggestive of a benign etiology without findings of active or latent tuberculosis infection (Figure ). The patient was recommended to schedule a follow-up appointment in six months while maintaining a close observation of her symptoms.\nSix months later, her cough reoccurred after an initial improvement over the past few months. The cough was accompanied by occasional sputum. She denied fever, chills, night sweat, sore throat, chest pain, dyspnea, or weight loss. She had been in close contact with people who were diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection. She was recommended to undergo a pulmonary function test (PFT) as well as a chest CT for further evaluation. She was prescribed dextromethorphan for symptomatic relief, educated on the symptoms of active tuberculosis, and instructed to give frequent updates of her symptoms. CT with intravenous contrast revealed a high right paratracheal and medial right apical heterogeneous soft tissue with central areas of calcification (Figure ). She agreed to opt for a routine endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) to rule out malignancy.\nBronchoscopy inspection revealed unremarkable trachea, left upper lobe, left lingula, left lower lobe, right middle lobe, and right lower lobe; but interestingly, no right upper lobe was observed. Furthermore, EBUS-TBNA showed a right paratracheal mass without surrounding lymphadenopathies that was biopsied and sent to pathology for analysis. The presumptive diagnosis for the right paratracheal mass was likely due to a nondeveloped right upper lung with associated scarring and atelectasis. The pathology report later confirmed the finding as there was no indication of malignancy or fungal infection. What is the patient's Centor Score?",

    "question": "In March 2015, a 45-year-old Korean woman presented to our emergency department (ED) with shortness of breath and an episode of seizure. Five hours before arriving in the ED, she developed a tonic-clonic seizure for 30 seconds and a high temperature of 40℃. The patient had preceding upper respiratory infection 4 days before coming to the ED. She also complained of severe coughing productive of blood-tinged sputum, and generalized myalgias. Her past medical history was unremarkable except for recurrent (one or two per year) epileptic seizures with oral phenytoin maintenance for 25 years. She had no known allergies. She did not receive the seasonal influenza vaccine.\nOn physical examination, the patient's blood pressure was 91/59 mmHg, and she had tachycardia (114/min), tachypnea (32/min), and a temperature of 37.9℃. She looked acutely ill, but was mentally alert. Examination of her lungs revealed coarse crackles throughout bilaterally. Other findings were unremarkable. A chest radiograph showed cardiomegaly and bilateral patchy consolidations. An electrocardiogram revealed low QRS voltage in the precordial leads (the entire QRS-complex amplitude was <8 mm). Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH of 7.38, carbon dioxide tension of 27.7 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen of 59.8 mmHg, bicarbonate level of 16.7 mmol/L, base excess of 6.4 mmol/L, and oxygen saturation level of 90.7%. The patient was given supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula (2 L/min).\nInitial laboratory findings revealed a hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL, white blood cell count of 18.8 × 103/mm3 (neutrophils, 85.6%), platelet count of 504 × 103/mm3, blood urea nitrogen level of 14.9 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein level of 4.92 mg/L (normal range, 0.0-5.0 mg/L). An influenza rapid antigen test on the patient's nasopharyngeal swab sample, which was promptly performed because of residual seasonal influenza activity in the community, was positive for influenza A virus. She was immediately given a single dose (300 mg) of IV peramivir, and levofloxacin, 500 mg/day.\nThe patient's dyspnea worsened, however, and she became hypotensive (blood pressure, 86/53 mmHg). She was managed with increased oxygen supply (4 L/min), furosemide, and norepinephrine (0.125 µg/kg/min). Additional blood tests revealed the following component levels: troponin I, 1.36 ng/mL (normal range, 0.0-0.16 ng/mL); creatine kinase-MB (CKMB), 49.27 ng/mL (normal range, 0.0-3.61 ng/mL); creatine phosphokinase (CPK), 1,585 IU/L (normal range, 38-185 IU/L); lactate dehydrogenase, 937 IU/L (normal range, 238-422 IU/L); N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide, 162.8 pg/mL (normal range, 0-125 pg/mL), and myoglobin, 138.8 ng/mL (normal range, 25-58 ng/mL). Serology for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and HIV were all negative.\nA chest computed tomography scan demonstrated multifocal patch consolidations in both lungs, with ground-glass opacities, suggestive of pulmonary edema or atypical pneumonia. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a depressed left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction of 30%, LV enlargement, diffuse hypokinesia with sparing LV apex, and decreased right ventricular apical wall motion, which was compatible with acute myocarditis ().\nThe patient was clinically diagnosed with influenza A-associated fulminant myocarditis, resulting in pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock, and admitted to the intensive care unit. On day 2 of hospitalization, her hemodynamic state had stabilized and she no longer required norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure within a normal range. A follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram taken on day 3 showed improved ventricular systolic function, with LV ejection fraction at 55% to 60%. Laboratory tests on day 4 revealed a troponin I level of 0.168 ng/mL, CK-MB level of 41.31 ng/mL, and CPK level of 1,459 IU/L. On day 5 of her hospitalization, the patient's dyspnea had improved and supplemental oxygen was stopped. On day 6, she was transferred to a general ward. A follow-up chest computed tomography scan demonstrated improved status of pulmonary edema, with residual, mild bilateral pleural effusion. The patient was discharged with recovery on day 9 after admission. Although her muscle enzyme levels still remained elevated 16 days after discharge (CK-MB, 42.63 ng/mL; CPK, 1,340 IU/L), she had been asymptomatic and carefully observed in the outpatient clinic ().\nMonitoring of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays (Real-Q Flu A, B Detection Kit; BioSewoom Inc., Seoul, Korea) using the patient's nasopharyngeal aspirates showed positivity for both influenza A (threshold cycle value, 27.23) and subtype hH3N2 (threshold cycle value, 27.39) on day 2 (), but became negative by day 4 of the patient's hospitalization.

He was diagnosed of having schizophrenia 4 years ago and was attending a psychiatric clinic. He was started on clozapine, 4 weeks ago (200 mg daily), because of inadequate control of symptoms with conventional antipsychotics. On examination he was febrile (102 °F), not pale or icteric. He did not have lymphadenopathy. Blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg and pulse rate was 110 bpm with good volume. His respiratory rate was 32 cycles per minute. Examination of the abdomen, cardiovascular and respiratory systems were unremarkable.\nHis full blood count (FBC), which was done a day prior to hospital admission showed white blood cell count (WBC) 2.9 × 103/µl, absolute neutrophil count 667/µl (23 %), lymphocytes 2117/µl (73 %), Hemoglobin (Hb) 11.3 g/dl, platelet 188 × 103/µl. The first FBC during the hospital stay showed reduced blood counts, of which WBC 0.2 × 103/µl with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 110/µl, lymphocyte count 80/µl, Hb 12.2 g/dl and platelet 972 × 103/µl. The C reactive protein was (CRP) 270 mg/L (<6 mg/L). His chest X ray, ultrasound scan (USS) of abdomen and pelvis, urine full report was normal. Serology for dengue virus, human immunodeficiency virus and parvo B19 virus were negative. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia.\nClinical diagnosis of neutropenic sepsis was made. He was treated with intravenous imipenum, vancomycin, clindamycin, metronidazole and fluconazole. His serial blood cultures, urine cultures and sputum cultures were negative. His FBC was monitored twice daily throughout hospital stay, showed severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia which later complicated by anemia from the 3rd day of hospital stay (Table ; Fig. ). The reticulocyte count was 1.1 % (normal 0.5–2.5). The patient was transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) on the 3rd day and treated with granulocyte colony stimulating factors (G-CSF) 300 µg daily for 10 days. On the 5th day he developed swelling of his left inguinal region with mild skin induration. The initial USS of left groin showed only subcutaneous tissue oedema. This subsequently progressed to an abscess which was drained. His white cell count and platelet count improved with 10 days of treatment with G-CSF. Hemoglobin normalized in 4 weeks of treatment. At this stage his WBC count was 12 × 103/µl with absolute neutrophil count 7200/µl (60 %), hemoglobin 12.6 g/dl and platelets 212 × 103/µl.

At baseline, the patient was minimally mobile due to active polymyositis. The patient was less responsive and confused with episodes of falling from her bedside commode. She denied having a cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. In the last week, she had close contact with her grandchildren, who experienced a flu-like illness without rash treated with an antibiotic.\nOn physical examination, her vitals were significant for elevated blood pressure of 174/82 mmHg, the temperature of 37.1 °C (98.7 °F), respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. Bilateral lower extremity swelling was present. On neurological exam, she was alert but not oriented on the place and time. Her Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) was 13. The patient showed decreased consciousness level, slowly followed commands, and slurred speech. Her reflexes were diminished: 2/4 in the bilateral biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellae, and Achilles. The rest of the exams were unremarkable without any focal neurological signs. Laboratory tests as noted in Table . The hepatitis panel was negative, and blood cultures showed no growth at 120 hours.\nComputed tomography (CT) brain without contrast showed scattered white matter hypodensities, which were nonspecific but compatible with chronic microvascular ischemic disease.\nFurther ischemic workup was deferred due to acute kidney injury in the setting of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4. The patient had minimal responsiveness with a loop diuretic, and therefore she was started on hemodialysis for better volume management. MRI brain without contrast showed 14 mm high T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal intensity focus in the left temporal lobe, suspicious for primary versus metastatic neoplasm (Figure ). The neurologist was consulted and recommended a follow-up assessment with a gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the brain.\nCT chest/abdomen/pelvis with intravenous (IV) contrast did not find any malignancy or metastatic disease. Given the cortical location of intracranial lesions, she was started prophylactically on levetiracetam 250 mg daily. Electroencephalograms (EEG) showed generalized slowing and triphasic waves. MRI with contrast was deferred due to worsening kidney. With her history of chronic steroid therapy, a lumbar puncture (LP) was considered and showed protein 75 mg/dL (15-60 mg/dL), glucose 55 mg/dL (50-80 mg/dL), WBC 22/mm3 (0-8/mm3), 7RBC/mm3 (<1RBC/mm3), with a pleocytosis of lymphocytic predominance. Meningitis/encephalitis polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel detected HHV-6. The patient was started on acyclovir 530 mg IV, and the infectious disease was consulted. Afterward, the patient was started on ganciclovir 75 mg IV as an induction dose for 14 days as ganciclovir has been shown in studies to be active against HHV6. Serologic testing also revealed a positive IgG 1:40 (reference <1:10) but negative IgM. Serum HHV-6 viral load was undetectable.\nRepeat MRI brain without contrast after 14 days of treatment with ganciclovir showed chronic microvascular-type ischemic disease and some T2 shine through in the left frontal area (Figure ). The location of abnormality seen in the left temporal region in the subcortical white matter was less prominent. By this time, there was a significant improvement in her mental status. She was not placed on prophylaxis because there was no clear indication due to her marked symptomatic improvement and resolution of the area of abnormality in the left temporal region on the MRI. The patient has been discharged with her home regimen of prednisone 10 mg for polymyositis.

The patient's history was obtained from the patient's mother. She denied any signs of vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, respiratory distress, ear pain, or a sore throat. Additionally, the patient showed signs of dehydration. Upon an initial examination, he was agitated but consolable. An examination of his ears revealed no external deformities; his canals were patent and without inflammation, and his tympanic membranes were intact, gray, translucent, and mobile. His nose showed no external deformities, and the nares were patent. His nasal turbinates were erythematous, but no inflammation was exhibited. His oral structures were normal for a child of his age, and the mucous membranes were moist and pink, without any lesions or exudates. His teeth did not have any dental caries. His neck was supple, and no cervical lymphadenopathy was present. The rest of his physical examination also revealed negative findings. The patient's fever and irritability warranted initial laboratory tests, including a rapid influenza test, a complete blood cell count (CBC), a C-reactive protein (CRP) test, and a blood culture. Abnormal values included leukocytosis that exhibited a left shift (26 500 cells/µL) and an elevated CRP (24.7 mg/L).\nDue to his elevated CBC and CRP, the patient was called back into the office for a re-evaluation the next day. His physical examination revealed new findings of erythematous tonsils with a midline uvula, as well as left and right posterior cervical nodes. The tenderness of the nodes was difficult to decipher because the patient was irritable throughout the examination. The hydration status of the patient had improved from the previous night. The rest of his physical examination revealed similar findings as the previous day. A urinalysis was obtained via catheterization and revealed negative results. Since his elevated WBC count raised concerns of the possibility of a bacterial infection, an intramuscular ceftriaxone injection was given. The patient was sent home with instructions to the parents to report any changes in his symptoms or any reactions to the antibiotics. Subsequent tests for CBC and CRP, which were obtained on the 4th day of the patient's symptoms, were still elevated, although the levels had improved (20 000 cells/µL and 14.6 mg/L, respectively). The patient initially responded well to the antibiotics; however, his fever returned, with a temperature of 103.8°F. He was seen again in the office on the 6th day of his symptoms.

    "question": "A 41-year-old female presenting with complaints of fever, chills, and symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection including sore throat and difficulty swallowing for three days arrived at our emergency department in December 2014. The patient did not have vomiting, diarrhea, chest distress, abdominal pain, rash, jaundice, cough, or expectoration. The patient had no history of smoking or alcohol intake, hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease or other chronic diseases, tuberculosis, hepatitis, typhoid fever, or other infectious diseases. In addition, there was no history of trauma, surgery or history of medicine, or food allergies. One month previously, the patient had been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and prescribed methimazole (10 mg BID) and propranolol (20 mg BID) at a local hospital. The patient discontinued the medicine after taking this treatment for ten days and three weeks prior to admission, since she thought that she may be pregnant because of a delayed menstrual cycle.\nThe patient's initial assessment in the emergency department revealed a temperature of 39.9°C, heart rate of 129 beats/min, and blood pressure of 174/76 mmHg. The patient had pharyngeal congestion, bilateral tonsil enlargement, and visible purulent secretions on bilateral tonsils. The patient had a mild hand tremor; however, there was no rash or jaundice. There were normal S1 and S2 sounds in cardiac examination. The patient's abdomen was normal, and no peripheral edema or lymphadenopathy was observed. There was bilateral grade 2 thyroid enlargement. There was no evidence of ophthalmopathy. The results of a neurologic and rheumatic examination were unremarkable.\nThe laboratory findings before antithyroid treatment were as follows: white blood cell count (WBC) and absolute neutrophil count were normal at 5200/μL (reference range, 3500 to 10500/μL) and 2300x/μL (reference range, 1500 to 8000/μL), respectively, with free T3, 16.8 pg/mL (reference range, 1.71–3.71 pg/mL), free T4 3.9 ng/dL (reference range, 0.7–1.48 ng/dL), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.0001 μIU/mL (reference range, 0.35–4.94 μIU/mL) in thyroid function tests.\nThe results from peripheral-blood count tests showed an absolute neutrophil count of zero and a WBC count of 400/μL at admission. Hemoglobin concentration and platelet count were normal at 13.6 g/dL (reference range, 11.5–16.5 g/dL) and 165 × 103/μL (reference range, 100–400 × 103/μL), respectively. C-reactive protein level was markedly elevated at 155 mg/L (reference range, 0–5 mg/L). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 18 mm/h (reference range, 0–10 mm/h). Thyroid function tests were as follows: free T3, 3.63 pg/mL (reference range, 1.71–3.71 pg/mL), free T4 2.2 ng/dL (reference range, 0.7–1.48 ng/dL), and TSH, 0.0001 μIU/mL (reference range, 0.35–4.94 μIU/mL). The pregnancy test was negative. Results from the electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Chest radiography divulged no infiltration. An abdominal ultrasonography was unremarkable. A peripheral-blood smear was normal except for agranulocytosis. There were no pathological findings except for borderline anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) positivity in rheumatic, viral, and bacterial serological tests (). Based on these results, the patient was diagnosed with ATD-induced agranulocytosis, acute tonsillitis, and hyperthyroidism.\nOn admission to our hospital, the patient was given intravenous antibiotics (amikacin and imipenem) to control infection and propranolol to hinder T4 transformation into T3 and to prevent excitatory effects on the heart. Methimazole was not restarted because of the neutropenia. After three days the neutrophil count increased to 600/μL, after six days the neutrophil count increased to 700/μL, and after seven days the neutrophil count increased to 2600/μL. After 10 days of treatment, a blood culture yielded no microbes, the neutrophil count was increased to 2900/μL, and the patient's symptoms were generally improved; the patient no longer had fever or throat symptoms. With clinical improvement of her symptoms and recovered neutropenia, antibiotherapy was discontinued.\nResults from the thyroid ultrasonography showed bilateral parenchymal heterogeneity, increment blood supply, and a 16 mm solitary nodule in the right thyroid lobe. On thyroid scintigraphy, there was diffusely increased radioiodine uptake in the thyroid gland and a hypoactive nodule in the right lobe. Fine needle aspiration biopsy performed at two different times on the nodule was insufficient. The option of surgical treatment was agreed upon because possible thyroid malignancy could not be ruled out due to inadequate biopsy results. In January 2015, she received a bilateral total thyroidectomy for surgical treatment after obtaining euthyroidism with combination therapy including lugol solution, corticosteroid, cholestyramine, and propranolol. The results of surgical histopathology were consistent with a benign nodular hyperplasia. The patient was followed with levothyroxine replacement treatment and the absolute neutrophil count remained within the reference range at 1600 to 3600/μL. What is the patient's Centor Score?",

    "question": "A 65-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hypothyroidism presented to the emergency department (ED) with shortness of breath which was progressively worsening two days prior to presentation. She also reported having a fever with a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius ( ͦC), chills, and nonproductive cough in the last two days. The patient denied exposure to sick contacts, recent travel outside the state, or recent immobilization. Her temperature on admission was 39 ͦC, blood pressure 132/80 mmHg, heart rate 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 per minute. Physical examination was significant for lethargy, bilateral rales on auscultation of lung fields. Her oxygen saturation was 88% while on 5 liters per minute delivered through nasal cannula so she was placed on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. Chest X-ray showed bilateral interstitial opacities consistent with viral pneumonia. The patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Laboratory results at the time of admission are presented in Table .\nShe was started on remdesevir and dexamethasone as per institutional guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19 viral pneumonia. A 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 120 per minute, so anticoagulation was started with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) 1mg/kg dosing twice daily and rate-controlling medications were administered. 12 hours after admission to the hospital, right arm motor drift, facial droop, and dysarthria were noted. National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 3. Emergent CT of the head revealed age indeterminate lacunar infarct in the left basal ganglia, with no intracranial hemorrhage. CT perfusion study of head and neck showed occlusion of the supraclinoid segment of the left internal carotid artery (ICA) with occlusive thrombus extending into the proximal left anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) (Figure ).\nLeft ACA opacified via an anterior communicating artery. Corresponding large 126 ccs of ischemic penumbra involving the left frontal, temporal and parietal lobes, basal ganglia were also seen. Anticoagulation was switched from LMWH to unfractionated heparin (UFH) in anticipation of the revascularization procedure. The case was discussed with an Interventional neurologist and the decision was made not to proceed with revascularization due to low NIHSS. While the patient was being monitored in the stroke unit, on day 3 of admission, she developed new right-sided hemiplegia, aphasia with altered mentation. The emergent CT of the head showed an increasing size of the infarct within the left basal ganglia and corona radiata. CT perfusion showed stable left ICA/MCA occlusion, however, due to progressive symptoms she underwent emergent left ICA/MCA thrombectomy. The weakness improved after revascularization with an increase in muscle strength from 1/5 to 3/5 in both right upper and lower extremities. UFH was discontinued due to an elevated risk of bleeding post revascularization.\nOn day 7 after the procedure, anticoagulation was restarted with LMWH due to coexisting atrial fibrillation and COVID-19 infection. At this point, the patient completed a 10-day course of remdesevir and dexamethasone and was saturating well with 3 liters per minute supplemental oxygen through the nasal cannula. two days after restarting anticoagulation, a stroke code was called due to sudden onset, left lower extremity weakness. CT perfusion of head and neck demonstrated new distal left M2 branch occlusion within the Sylvian fissure. Mural thrombi were noted in the distal aortic arch and descending aorta. A complete angiogram of the chest and abdomen was done to determine the extent of clot burden. CT angiogram of the chest confirmed the presence of mural thrombus (Figure ).\nAlong with that, a large filling defect was noted within the right interlobar pulmonary artery with extension into the right middle and lower lobe pulmonary artery as well as segmental and subsegmental branches of the right lower lobe compatible with pulmonary embolism (Figure ). CT angiogram of the abdomen showed thrombus in left common femoral artery extending into proximal internal iliac as well as left external iliac arteries (Figures , ). There is a reconstitution of flow within both arteries distally. Platelets dropped from 174 to 63 within few days after restarting anticoagulation (Figure ). 4T score for screening of HIT was 6 (2 each for greater than 50% drop and nadir >30, timing within 5-10 days of exposure and new thrombosis). LMWH was switched to argatroban infusion. Platelet factor 4 antibody test and serotonin release assay test (SRA) were positive (Table ).\nThe patient underwent a left lower extremity angiogram by vascular surgery and treated with tissue plasminogen activator catheter-directed thrombolysis (tPA-CDT). Revascularization was successful with three-vessel runoff and dopplerable pulses in the left lower extremity. Anticoagulation was subsequently switched to apixaban. The patient recovered from COVID-19 and was discharged to the nursing home for rehabilitation for stroke. What is the patient's Centor Score?",

    "question": "This is a case of a 70-year-old Caucasian male with a medical history of hypertension and osteoarthritis who presented with a two-week history of dizziness. He also reported a few episodes of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis. Four days prior to presentation, he was unable to carry on with his daily activities due to generalized weakness which prompted him to seek medical attention. Upon further review of systems, he was admitted with night sweats, subjective fevers, and loss of appetite resulting in a 40-pound weight loss over the past few months.\nOn physical exam, the patient had skin and conjunctival pallor. Vitals revealed orthostatic hypotension. Laboratory investigations indicated significant microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 7.1 g/dL (14–18 g/dL), decreased from his baseline of 14.5 g/dL one year prior, and a MCV of 66 fL (79–93.9 fL). He had leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.7 (4.5–11.0 K/UL) as well has thrombocytosis of 529 K/UL (130–400 K/UL). On chemistry, he was found to have acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 1.42 mg/dL (0.7–1.3 mg/dL) and BUN of 34 mg/dL (9–23 mg/dL) from a baseline creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. He was also found to have hypokalemia with a potassium level of 3.2 mmol/L (3.5–5.1 mmol/L) and metabolic alkalosis with an elevated CO2 level of 34 mg/dL (9–23 mg/dL). Analysis of laboratory values (AKI, mildly elevated leukocytosis, metabolic alkalosis, and hypokalemia) hinted towards dehydration likely resulting volume depletion from vomiting. Laboratory values resolved with hydration. In addition, the patient had a positive stool guaiac suggestive of GI bleed. He was transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells. He denied recent history of hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia and had an unremarkable colonoscopy 5 years prior to presentation.\nDue to symptomatic anemia, weight loss, and obstructive symptoms in the setting of a GI bleed, he underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy. EGD revealed severe diffuse hemorrhagic gastritis () with biopsies consistent with chronic gastritis and no malignant features. Colonoscopy showed localized, severe colitis at the cecum that was erythematous, friable, and ulcerative (). There was also extraluminal compression of the cecum with protrusion of the ileocecal valve and luminal narrowing ().\nDue to the extraluminal compression of the cecum, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous and oral contrast was obtained. This ultimately revealed a cecal mass measuring 12 × 12 × 4.7 cm with the bulk of the mass protruding into the terminal ileum causing high-grade narrowing of the lumen (). Lymphadenopathy was localized to the right lower quadrant, and no distant lymphadenopathy was observed elsewhere (). CT of the chest (with and without IV contrast) that was also done did not show pulmonary nodules, pleural or pericardial effusions, or lymphadenopathy to suggest distant disease.\nSubsequently, surgery was consulted, and due to his presentation with obstructive symptoms and symptomatic anemia secondary to the seen cecal mass, the patient underwent a right hemicolectomy. Pathology from both colonoscopy and right hemicolectomy showed MCL of cecum. The lymphoma cells expressed cyclin D, with characteristic cytogenetic abnormality of t (11; 14) (q13; q32). A high index of Ki-67 of 65% indicates adverse prognosis (Figures and ). MCL was also present in pericolonic lymph nodes.\nInitially, the patient declined further workup and treatment including chemotherapy and bone marrow biopsy. Nonetheless, two months after discharge, he presented to the Oncology Clinic willing to undergo further evaluation and treatment. At this time, PET/CT scan revealed advanced disease with hypermetabolic lymph nodes within the mediastinum and retroperitoneum, as well as diffuse omental caking and bilateral malignant pleural effusions; no uptake on the bony structures was identified. The patient was now diagnosed with advanced disease and stage IV MCL, contrary to initial presentation where lymphadenopathy was limited to the right lower quadrant.

There was no history of jaundice, fever, steatorrhea, or bleeding per rectum. There was no other significant medical or surgical history.\nThe patient had been treated with proton pump inhibitors, prokinetic agents by general practitioners, without any relief. His ultrasound examination and standing X-ray of abdomen had not shown any abnormality.\nPhysical examination was normal except minimal abdominal tenderness in epigastric, right hypochondriac region along with mild dehydration. His liver function tests, renal function tests, amylase, hemogram, and urinalysis were normal. Upper GI endoscopy was normal. A chest radiograph did not reveal air under the diaphragm.\nCT abdomen with contrast was done. In the study stomach and duodenum appeared connected to small intestine seen on right side giving a whirlpool appearance due to rotation of gut around the superior mesenteric artery. Superior mesenteric vein was seen on left of superior mesenteric artery [Figures and ]. Further distal bowel loops appeared collapsed. Thus the diagnosis of midgut malrotation with partial obstruction was confirmed.\nSurgical referral was made; he was treated with four-port laparoscopic Ladd's procedure.

    "question": "A previously healthy 23-year-old Japanese woman presented to the Internal Medicine Department in our hospital after 5 days of fever, sore throat, aphthous stomatitis, and enlargement of the bilateral cervical lymph nodes with tenderness. She experienced similar symptoms 1, 2, and 9 months ago, and in each case, these symptoms lasted for approximately 5 days regardless of therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or antibiotics. There was no remarkable family history except for her mother's neuromyelitis optica. Her menstrual period was regular. She had taken no drugs except for multi-ingredient cold medication prescribed by a local clinic. She had never traveled abroad.\nOn admission, her body temperature was 37.7°C, and her other vital signs were within the normal ranges. On physical examination, aphthous stomatitis, enlargement of the bilateral submandibular lymph nodes with tenderness, pharyngeal erythema, and enlarged palatine tonsils with white exudates were observed (Figure ).\nLaboratory investigations revealed slightly elevated serum transaminase (aspartate aminotransferase level, 112 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase level, 92 IU/L) and immunoglobulin D (29.1 mg/dL) levels. Bacterial cultures from a throat swab and blood sample showed no growth. Anti-Epstein-Barr virus capsid antigen immunoglobulin G and M titer were order of 160 and under the order of 10. Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen was not investigated. Computed tomography revealed enlargement of the bilateral submandibular lymph nodes with no evidence of other abnormal findings. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed no vegetations. The patient refused to undergo genetic examination.\nThe patient was diagnosed with PFAPA syndrome based on two clinical diagnostic criteria. She satisfied five of six items in Padeh's diagnosis criteria: monthly cyclic fever in any age group, possible aphthous stomatitis, cervical lymphadenitis, exudative tonsillitis with negative throat culture, completely asymptomatic during intervals, and rapid response to glucocorticoid. She also fulfilled four of five items in Thomas’ criteria: regularly recurring fever under 5 years old; presence of at least one of these symptoms, aphthous stomatitis, cervical adenitis, or pharyngitis, without upper respiratory infection; exclusion of cyclic neutropenia; completely asymptomatic during intervals; normal growth and development. Her diagnosis was confirmed with no evidence of other possible febrile diseases.\nAfter admission, her symptoms recovered within a few days without any treatment. We prescribed cimetidine 800 mg per day to prevent recurrence. Although the aphthous stomatitis and enlarged cervical lymph node appeared a few days per month, none of the other symptoms were observed again. Moreover, the aphthous stomatitis has also stopped occurring 5 months after starting cimetidine therapy (Figure ). What is the patient's Centor Score?",

The pain was not alleviated with over the counter acetaminophen use. She was not able to describe any alleviating or exacerbating factors. The visual changes were described by the patient as “blurry vision” and “double vision” affecting her left eye greater than her right. She reported photophobia and difficulty keeping the left eye open. The patient described this difficulty of keeping the eye open as a weakness and not secondary to pain. She had approximately five episodes of non-bloody and non-bilious vomiting over the past three days and reported inability to tolerate her home medications. She also reported a sore throat and cough productive of yellow sputum for the previous two to three days, but denied fever, chills, chest pain, hemoptysis, or dyspnea.\nHer past medical history included essential hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a remote history of uterine fibroids associated with iron deficiency anemia. Prescribed medications included losartan 25 milligrams (mg) and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg. She had no known drug allergies, did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs.

She was a vaccinated (quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine on October 9, 2017) 4th-grade student who lived with both parents and two younger siblings. All family members had received the 2017/2018 influenza vaccine. A home visit was conducted 25 hours after symptom onset. Her moderate ILI was characterized by fever (measured temperature = 37.2°C after antipyretic), chills, cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, headache, malaise, myalgia, anorexia, and sneezing. There was no recent travel, exposure to farm animals, or identified sick contact preceding onset. Nasal and oropharyngeal specimens were collected. Although the RIDT result was negative, rRT-PCR was positive for influenza A (H3N2) (cycle threshold value [Ct] = 31.48) and RPP was positive for coronavirus HKU1. At follow-up, she reported 2 days of absenteeism and continued cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat, myalgia, and headache. There had been no medical follow-up or antiviral treatment. The rRT-PCR result from the subject's day 7 swab was negative for influenza. No other family members reported illness on day 0, but one sibling developed mild respiratory illness on day 6. All family members tested negative for influenza by rRT-PCR on day 0 and day 7.\nOn March 9, 2018, 37 days after the initial encounter, the subject was again screened due to a new ILI episode. A home visit was conducted 49 hours after symptom onset. Now 10 years old, the subject complained of significant symptoms including fever (measured temperature = 37.6°C after antipyretic), chills, cough, wheezing, nasal congestion, headache, malaise, myalgia, anorexia, burning eyes, and dizziness. Again, there was no recent travel, exposure to farm animals, or identified sick contact preceding onset. The subject's RIDT result was positive for influenza A, and rRT-PCR results confirmed the presence of influenza A (H3N2) (Ct = 26.48). At follow-up, she reported 2 days of absenteeism and continued fever, chills, cough, rhinorrhea, malaise, myalgia, headache, and anorexia. There had been no medical follow-up or antiviral treatment. The rRT-PCR results from the subject's day 7 swab continued to show influenza A (H3N2) (Ct = 33.30). No other family members reported illness on day 0 or day 7. All family members tested negative for influenza by rRT-PCR on day 0 and day 7.\nThe subject's initial specimen from each episode, collected on January 31 and March 9, 2018, was prepared for full genomic sequencing at the WSLH. Both A (H3N2) strains were of the hemagglutinin gene clade 3C2.a2. After WSLH performed a consensus sequence comparison between the two viruses collected from the subject, three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified within the coding region of the HA protein. Only one SNP was non-synonymous and resulted in an isoleucine to leucine change at position 67 (in HA1). This particular polymorphism was near 100% frequency in the sequence reads and was four amino acids away from an established antibody epitope site (Site E). Both sequences (first isolate ORCH00001 and second isolate ORCH00002) were submitted to the GenBank® genetic sequence database and given accession numbers (MK262897 and MK262898, respectively).

This was associated with cough, sore-throat and headache. There was no associated dyspnoea, tachypnoea, haemoptysis or chest pain on coughing. Besides the severe frontal throbbing headache, he had generalized body aches, myalgia and severe malaise. On the following day, he developed nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. The vomitus consisted of food taken and was not bile-stained. The stool was described as watery without excessive mucous and it was non-malenic. The gastrointestinal symptom was associated with abdominal pain and loss of appetite. His illness was not relieved with self-medication of antipyretics. On review, there was no associated giddiness, blurring of vision, photophobia, skin bleeding or arthritis.\nHe sought medical treatment at the government health clinic in Kampar on 21 August 2006. At the outpatient clinic, he was noted to be febrile (an axillary temperature of 40.1 degree Celsius), ill-looking with a generalized body erythema that blanched on pressure and was more prominent over the face and upper trunk. He had mild conjunctivitis but there was no jaundice. His tonsils were enlarged and injected but there was no white exudate noted over the tonsils. He was not in any respiratory distress and his lungs were clear with good air entry on auscultation. Other systemic examination was essentially normal and there was no significant lymphadenopathy noted. A provisional diagnosis of influenza-like illness was made at which he was given a higher dose of anti-pyretic.

    "question": "A 50-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital with progressive dyspnea, cough, and cold sweats. He mentioned night sweating for a year and 15 kilograms weight loss. His medical history stated a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection since 2003, with a double-sided pneumonia with Pneumocystis jirovecii (among other pathogens) at admittance, therefore diagnosed as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Patient was treated with antiretroviral therapy with an undetectable viral load in 2012, but had stopped taking medication 1 year ago. He lived in a homeless shelter with his wife (who was also HIV positive); his children were accommodated elsewhere. There was no (intravenous) drug or alcohol use, and he had quit smoking 15 years ago. Physical examination on admission showed a non-acutely ill patient, tachypneic with an oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. His blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg, heart rate 132 per minute, and temperature 38.2°C. Percussion of the lungs did not reveal any dullness, and at auscultation normal breath sounds were heard except for the left lower side. Other physical examination was unremarkable.\nRelevant laboratory results on admission were hemoglobin 7.2 mmol/L, white blood cell count 6.6 × 109/L, platelets 214 × 109/L, and C-reactive protein (CRP) 64 mg/L. There was no renal or hepatic insufficiency. Immunology results were as follows: CD4: 0.039 × 109/L, CD8: 1.2 × 109/L, CD4/CD8 ratio: 0.033. A chest X-ray showed bilateral “cloudy” infiltrates.\nThe patient was treated according to the local sepsis protocol, with gentamicin 280 mg and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 1200 mg intravenously in the emergency room. This was followed by cotrimoxazole (3 × 1920 mg) and prednisolone (2 × 40 mg) the next day for suspected PJP. Two days after admission, a bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed to confirm the diagnosis. Directly after this procedure, the patient became dyspneic, had low oxygen saturations (82%), and developed subcutaneous emphysema. Due to progressive respiratory insufficiency, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were necessary. Bronchoscopy-guided intubation was performed in the operating theater, which was uneventful. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest immediately after intubation showed subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema without pneumothorax. Also, severe air bronchograms and bilateral infiltrations were seen. Patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) afterward.\nDuring the (ventilatory) treatment on the ICU, the subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema increased, resulting in swelling of the entire face, arms, and torso down to the scrotum (). Several bronchoscopies were performed to exclude tracheal injury that could have occurred during the BAL, but no injury was visualized. Despite efforts to treat patient with lung protective ventilation, using low tidal volumes and low airway pressures, the emphysema continued to increase. A new CT scan was performed 1 week after admission to the ICU, showing severe subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema (). Treatment of the emphysema by skin incisions alone (“blow holes”) was considered but discarded due to the high HIV viral load (700,000 copies/mL) of the patient and the fear of viral spreading by blood spatters. Because of the severity and increase of the symptoms and no obvious tracheal injury (on subsequent bronchoscopies and CT scans), a search for other treatment options was performed. After elaborate consideration, it was decided to make two infraclavicular skin incisions and place VAC therapy on these incisions (ActiV.A.C., KCI Medical, –125 mm Hg; ). While the subcutaneous emphysema started to improve significantly, a gradual clinical improvement was seen in the first week. VAC therapy was ended 9 days after initiation. The subcutaneous emphysema continued to decrease after removal of the VAC therapy system.\nDuring his stay on the ICU, inflammatory markers decreased together with the pulmonary infiltrations on the chest X-ray, implying adequate treatment of the PJP. Patient was extubated after 17 days of mechanical ventilation, with a significant ICU-acquired weakness. Furthermore, dysphonia was reported, possibly caused by emphysema of the larynx. The patient was discharged to the general ward 25 days after admission to the ICU.

He had been administered antibiotics orally for tonsillitis almost every 1-2 months for his complaints. These episodes had been usually associated with fever. He also had a history of five episodes of afebrile convulsions with temporary vision loss. Although laboratory results were negative for tuberculosis, he was administered antituberculosis therapy for one year because of the opacity noted in his chest roentgenogram (). However, he did not respond to the therapy. Also, he had been suffering from polyuria and polydipsia for almost three years. He has been drinking water (6 L/m2/day) and waking up approximately three times to drink and urinate each night.\nAt the time of admission, the patient’s vital functions were within normal ranges. Physical examination revealed a thin child who weighed 23 kg (15th percentile) and measured 115 cm in height (30th percentile) but appeared to be healthy. His oral mucosa was dry and breath sounds were reduced on the left side. Other physical findings were normal including the neurological system.\nLaboratory results showed a hemoglobin level of 11.7 g/dL, a total leucocyte count of 10.800/mm3, and a differential count within normal ranges. While the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (82 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (38 mg/L) were elevated, the electrolytes, serum calcium, uric acid, as well as renal and liver functions were within normal ranges. Basal serum sodium, urea, and glucose levels were also within normal ranges (142 meq/L, 11 mg/dL, and 96 mg/dL, respectively). Before the water deprivation test, urine specific gravity, serum and urine osmolarity values were 1,000, 293 mOsm/kg, and 133 mOsm/kg, respectively. Following a 14-hour period of water deprivation, the serum sodium level increased to 155 meq/L and urine specific gravity, serum and urine osmolality were found as 1,007, 323 mOsm/kg and 240 mOsm/kg, respectively. Serum antidiuretic hormone was <0.5 pg/mL both before and after the water deprivation test and these levels were consistent with cDI. Polyuria and polydipsia symptoms were relieved with desmopressin. The pituitary hormone profile was in normal ranges except for a low level of insulin-like growth factor of 79 ng/dL (-2/-3 SDS) and antidiuretic hormone. CNS investigation revealed presence of two 10- and 14-mm lesions on the left parietal and temporo-occipital lobes and a small adenohypophysis (2 mm in diameter). The infundibulum was normal in appearance, but neurohypophysis intensity was decreased (, ).\nContrast-enhanced computed tomography of the chest showed a large lobulated calcified mass (, ). The lung biopsy gave no morphological clues of malignancy, such as increased and/or abnormal mitotic activity, conspicuous cellular atypia, or necrosis (). Immunohistochemically, the proliferating cells were highlighted with vimentin, smooth muscle actin, and muscle-specific actin. Focal and weak immunoreactivity against desmin was also noted in some areas. There was no nuclear staining with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). These morphological findings were interpreted to be in favor of IMT. Later, a thorough examination of the resection material also confirmed the diagnosis of IMT.\nClinical and pathological findings suggested IMT. The mass was excised with an incision extending from the diaphragm to the pericardium, and the invaded part in the atrium was trimmed. After an uneventful pneumonectomy, the patient was discharged. Corticosteroid or chemotherapy was not considered because of the unclear benefits. Three months after pneumonectomy, the patient’s acute phase reactants decreased to normal levels and the febrile episodes diminished, due to resection of the inflammatory focus. A contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance scan performed three months after the pneumonectomy showed findings similar to the former magnetic resonance image, with two well-defined round lesions with perifocal edema.\nCurrently, the patient is being followed with regard to his growth velocity, potential adenohypophysis hormone deficiency, as well as with regard to cerebral lesions.

The ear discharge was sent for bacterial culture which showed no growth. The patient was taking topical ciprofloxacin ear drops, without any resolution of the symptoms.\nOn examination of the ear, it revealed mild myringitis, thickening of the posterior ear canal, and active purulent discharge. There was some pinkish-to-pale colored granulation tissue at the posterosuperior quadrant of the tympanic membrane ().\nThe tympanic membrane was intact. The patient was concerned about malignancy and we took tissue from the granulations at the ear canal and sent it for histopathological examination. Histopathological examination showed squamous epithelium with granulo- matous inflammation. The acid-fast bacilli stain was positive for acid-fast bacilli ().\nThere were no fungal hyphae on Grocott’s methenamine silver stain and no evidence of any malignancy. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue was positive for Myco-bacterium tuberculosis, which was surprising.\nThe patient was then properly evaluated by chest physicians, and denied any fever, cough, weight loss, or hemoptysis. He had no past history of exposure to tuberculosis. The patient’s routine laboratory findings including complete blood count, liver function tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and serum creatinine were normal.

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the both sides of the temporal bone was performed, which showed narrowing of the left external auditory canal ().\nThis lesion was treated for extrapulmonary tuberculosis, including rifampicin (600 mg daily), isoniazid (300 mg daily), pyrazinamide (2,000 mg) daily, and ethambutol (1600 mg) daily for 2 months. The isoniazid and rifampicin were continued for the next 8 months. The patient’s otorrhea was resolved within 1 month after starting the antitubercular therapy (ATT). Examination of the external auditory canal and tympanic membrane were normal after 6 months of treatment. What is the patient's FeverPAIN score?",

    "question": "A 29-years-old female experienced an episode of mild upper respiratory tract infection followed by a slowly developing dysphagia and dyspnea. This led to impaired exercise tolerance lasting several months, with recent subacute exacerbation. There was no significant history of travel or exposure to infectious agents. She had not suffered from fever or other acute or chronic infectious symptoms. Her palatine tonsils had been removed in childhood. She was diagnosed with epilepsy at age 17 and had been free of epileptic symptoms for over 5 years with levetiracetam (500 mg two times per day) and lamotrigine (150 mg two times per day). Her family history was unremarkable.\nShe spoke with hoarse voice, without signs or findings that would have suggested systemic involvement. There were no signs of generalized mucosal disease. Fiberoptic examination showed swelling of the lingual tonsil, epiglottic and arytenoid mucosa, causing airway obstruction (Fig. a). C-reactive protein concentration and blood sedimentation rate were low, and anti-nuclear, anti-neutrophil, anti-glomerular basement membrane, anti-myeloperoxidase, anti-proteinase 3, tissue transglutaminase and cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies were negative. Thyroid function was normal and thyroid peroxidase antibodies were 34 IU/ml (normal value < 60 IU/ml). Plasma parathyroid hormone (39 ng/l; normal 18–80 ng/l) and serum vitamin D-25 (77 nmol/l; normal > 50 nmol/l) were normal. No evidence for acute or chronic viral, bacterial, mycobacterial or fungal infections, including hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency virus and tularemia, was found.\nDue to her swollen lingual tonsil and laryngeal mucosa causing airway obstruction, she was hospitalized and received empiric cefuroxime (1.5 g thrice daily) and methylprednisolone (75 mg once daily, height 173 cm, weight 63 kg, prednisolone dose 1.2 mg/kg) intravenously. After a transient positive response, she was discharged from the hospital after 6 days. Soon after, she was readmitted to due to a rapid reoccurrence of the symptoms. A modest positive response was seen after per oral clindamycin and oral prednisolone (60 mg/days) with dose reduction for 14 days. Lingual tonsil and epiglottis were biopsied. Histology showed granulomatous reaction in lingual tonsil with CD68+ (Kp-1) epithelioid histiocytes (Fig. ). The CD20+ B lymphocyte count was increased while Pax-5+ positive B lymphocyte count was normal. CD138+ plasma cells were scarce, and they showed polytypic kappa- and lambda light chain expression. The number of CD3+ T cells was normal, and most T cells were CD4+. Eosinophils were practically absent and well-formed follicles were not seen. Epstein–Barr virus in situ hybridization (EBER), p16, cytomegalovirus and mycobacteria were negative. Morphology, immunohistochemical staining, serum electrophoresis and bone marrow aspirate did not raise suspicion of lymphoid neoplasia, thus, no clonality studies were done.\nDue to granulomas, sarcoidosis was considered. However, chest X-ray, computerized tomography of chest and ultrasound of neck and abdomen were unremarkable. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) showed increased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the lingual tonsil, without evidence of widespread sarcoidosis (Fig. ). No other pathological FDG foci were found. Focal physiological FDG accumulation was seen in ureters on both sides of the spinal column. This is a common finding due to ureteral peristalsis and pooling of radiotracer in the recumbent patient. The patient had no neurological symptoms and brain magnetic resonance imaging was normal. Serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was within normal range (11–20 U/l; reference range 9–65 U/l) while daily urine calcium output was normal or slightly elevated (5.0–6.31 mmol; reference range 1.2–5.5 mmol).\nSubsequently, an unusual presentation of primary or secondary immunodeficiency was considered. There was no consanguinity; the patient or her family had no history of repeated infections or autoimmunity. White cell, lymphocyte, and B, T and NK lymphocyte subset counts were within normal limits. CD19+ B cell count was 153 × 109/l (normal range 80–616 × 109/l). Proportions of memory CD27+ B-cells (30.3%) and IgD−IgM−CD27+ switched memory B cells 7.2%; (normal range 6.5–29.2%) were normal and the percentage of activated CD21low B cells was high (6.6%; normal range 0.6–3.5%). Percentages of various CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cell subsets appeared normal. Serum total IgG (3.5 g/l; normal range 6.77–15.0 g/l) and all IgG subclass concentrations were low: IgG1 2.45 g/l (normal range 4.9–11.4 g/l), IgG2 0.91 g/l (normal range 1.5–6.4 g/l), IgG3 0.18 g/l (normal range 0.2–1.1 g/l) and IgG4 0.02 g/L (normal range 0.08–1.4 g/l). Anti-polysaccharide response to Pneumovax® were impaired, with only 3/10 serotypes reaching a level of 0.35 µg/ml after immunization. However, serum IgA (0.90 g/l; normal range 0.52–4.02 g/l) and IgM concentrations (0.57 g/l; normal range 0.47–2.84 g/l) were normal. Dihydrorhodamine test excluded chronic granulomatous disease. These findings were thus consistent with either granulomatous CVID or most likely secondary drug-induced hypogammaglobulinemia with a novel clinical presentation [–]. Genetic analysis (Blueprint Genetics, Primary Immunodeficiency Plus panel. ) did not find known mutations causative of CVID-like or other primary immunodeficiencies.\nDue to symptomatic upper airway obstruction, dysphagia, lack of evident infection and unsatisfactory response to prednisolone treatment and possible granulomatous CVID, the patient received immunoglobulin replacement and rituximab therapy (Mabthera® 100 mg, 200 mg and 500 mg on three consecutive days combined with 100 mg hydrocortisone and 1 g paracetamol), with a favorable response within 2 weeks accompanied by significant improvement in dysphagia and respiratory symptoms. Seven months later, her exercise capacity was good. She has remained asymptomatic for over 16 months after rituximab treatment. Her fiberoptic pharyngeal findings improved (Fig. ). She continues to receive subcutaneous immunoglobulin replacement with serum IgG levels in the range of 10 to 12 g/l. What is the patient's FeverPAIN score?",

    "question": "A 63-year-old Caucasian man presented to our hospital with 2 weeks of progressive generalized weakness, vague abdominal discomfort, and dyspnea on exertion requiring more frequent use of his inhaler. He did not report similar symptoms in the past, and he denied any associated chest pain, cough, changes in bowel habits, fevers, chills, weight loss, recent travel, tick bites, or sick contacts. His past medical history was relevant for chronic bronchitis diagnosed 10 years ago. He was a former one-pack-per-day smoker for 20 years. His family history was noncontributory.\nThe patient’s vital signs at presentation showed a blood pressure of 128/84 mmHg, heart rate of 75 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths/minute, oxygen saturation of 99% on room air, and body temperature of 97.7 °F. On physical examination, the patient was in no apparent distress and was awake, alert, and oriented to person, place, and time. His heart and lung examination revealed sinus tachycardia and diffuse expiratory wheezes throughout the lung fields. The patient’s abdominal examination was pertinent for a nonperitonitic tenderness to palpation in the left upper quadrant. His neurological examination was remarkable for weakness in the right upper extremity. His laboratory data are summarized in Table .\nSee Fig. for the timeline of the patient’s kidney function and absolute eosinophil count while receiving steroid treatment.\nFindings of computed tomography (CT) of the patient’s brain were unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain revealed subacute infarcts involving the left frontal white matter and left cerebellum; in addition, an evolving subacute infarct was seen in the left corona radiata. CT of the chest demonstrated diffuse ground-glass opacity, and CT of the abdomen was remarkable for a wedge-shaped area of low attenuation in the spleen consistent with splenic infarct. His transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a mural apical thrombus in the left ventricular (LV) apex with reduced ejection fraction (31–35%). Cardiac MRI performed 7 days after anticoagulation therapy was initiated showed a diffuse subendocardial scarring of the middle to apical LV segments and the right ventricular side of the septum. It also revealed evidence of edema of the middle anteroseptum and apical septum, consistent with endomyocardial fibrosis. However, no mural thrombus was visualized.\nA presumptive diagnosis of HES was made on the basis of presenting symptoms, laboratory data, and imaging studies. Investigation for secondary causes, including immunological testing (Table ), blood and urine cultures, ova and parasites, and infectious serology (Table ), were unrevealing, and results of urine drug screening were negative. Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated a normocellular bone marrow population with eosinophilia comprising 60–70%, without evidence of lymphoproliferative disorder or metastatic neoplasm. Cytogenetic analysis was unrevealing: negative for breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (BCR-ABL1) fusion, eosinophilia-associated platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA), platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB), fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) mutation, and JAK2 pericentriolar material 1 (PCM1) fusion.\nDue to the stigma of hemolysis (normocytic acute anemia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase and bilirubin, positive schistocytes with relative thrombocytopenia), further investigation was pursued. The result of the Coombs test (direct and indirect) was negative. A disintegrin-like and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motif 13 (ADAMTS13) activity level was greater than 50%, and the expression of complement regulatory proteins CD59 and CD55 on erythrocytes was within normal limits as determined by flow cytometry.\nDue to a further decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) early in the patient’s hospital course, a kidney biopsy was pursued. Renal biopsy revealed a glomerular and vascular TMA, interstitial fibrosis, and inflammation with focal eosinophils (Fig. ). IHC staining for eosinophil granule major basic protein 1 (MBP1) was not performed.\nOur patient was started on prednisone 1 mg/kg daily and a heparin protocol at 18 U/kg/hour with an activated partial thromboplastin time goal of 60–100 seconds. Simultaneously, warfarin was initiated. Once the patient’s international normalized ratio was within therapeutic range (2.0–3.0), he was anticoagulated with heparin and warfarin for an additional 48 hours. His eosinophil count and estimated GFR were monitored on an outpatient basis, and his prednisone dose was gradually tapered. After the eighth week, the patient was maintained on 5 mg of prednisone daily.\nBy the time the renal biopsy report was available, the patient’s kidney function had started to recover; hence, no further intervention was required. After initiation of treatment with steroids, the patient achieved resolution of pulmonary, cardiac, neurologic, and abdominal symptoms. Repeat echocardiography after 5 weeks showed improvement of LV ejection fraction to 50–55%. Complete normalization of eosinophil count and renal function was observed after 4 and 8 weeks of therapy, respectively (Fig. ). At his 10-week follow-up, the patient continued to do well under close surveillance for renal and cardiac complications. At 12-month follow-up, he continued to have a normal eosinophil count and renal function. However, cardiac MRI showed persistent endocardial fibrosis. What is the patient's FeverPAIN score?",

    "question": "A 65-year-old male marathon runner presented to a primary care physician with abrupt onset of posterior left knee pain that began two days before. There had been no injury associated with the pain. He denied systemic symptoms, including fever, chills, night sweats, or malaise. Past medical history included asymptomatic severe mitral valve regurgitation secondary to bileaflet mitral valve prolapse, for which he underwent robot-assisted minimally invasive mitral valve repair and prosthetic ring placement approximately 6 months prior to presentation. There was also a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He lived in the central United States with his wife and was employed as an attorney. He consumed approximately two alcoholic drinks per night, was a never smoker, and had no history of intravenous drug use. There were no other significant exposures or travel documented.\nThe patient recovered from his mitral valve repair, had stopped anticoagulation after 6 weeks, and had returned to walking and/or running 3–5 miles per day. A transthoracic echocardiogram that was done approximately 2 months postoperatively demonstrated a normal functioning valve, with only trace regurgitation.\nHe was initially treated with symptomatic pain relief with hydrocodone-acetaminophen but had no improvement in the left popliteal fossa pain and was therefore referred to an orthopedic provider. A plain radiograph demonstrated Baker's cyst and he was treated with a cortisone injection. Due to persistence of symptoms, he was subsequently evaluated for possible deep venous thrombosis via venous ultrasound which indicated a left popliteal thrombus and aneurysm. As a result of this finding, he was admitted to an outside hospital for further evaluation.\nAt the outside facility, he underwent MRI of the left knee, CT angiogram with bilateral extremity runoff, and transthoracic echocardiogram. These studies revealed left popliteal aneurysm with occlusive eccentric thrombus and incomplete clot of a right renal artery branch. The following day, a transthoracic echocardiogram was done and showed a highly mobile mass attached to the anterior mitral valve leaflet, measuring approximately 1.5 cm.\nDue to the abnormal findings, he was transferred to our facility for further evaluation and management. On admission, the patient appeared well. Temperature was 36.8°C, blood pressure was 123/48, heart rate was 85 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute, and peripheral oxygen saturations were 98% on room air. A 1/6 holosystolic murmur heard best over the mitral valve was auscultated; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. There was no mention of onychomycosis. His laboratory evaluation demonstrated mild anemia (11.4 g/dL; reference 13.5–17.5 g/dL), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (60 mm/1 hour; reference 0–22 mm/1 hour), and elevated C-reactive protein (75.9 mg/L; reference < 8.0 mg/L). The peripheral white blood cell count and differential, platelet count, INR, and prothrombin time were all normal.\nThe patient underwent transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) which revealed two highly mobile masses attached to the mitral valve with the largest mass measuring approximately 1 cm by 3 cm. The patient underwent surgery the following day. Intraoperatively, the mitral valve had firm, white vegetations with destruction of both anterior and posterior leaflets. Samples were taken and sent immediately to pathology for review. The preliminary frozen pathology demonstrated fungal elements (Figures and ). He underwent aggressive debridement and mitral valve replacement with a porcine valve. The patient was started on intravenous liposomal amphotericin B 5 mg/kg/day intraoperatively and caspofungin 50 mg daily was added the next day for empiric treatment while waiting identification of the organism. Final pathology described active native valve endocarditis with fungal organisms involving the myxomatous mitral valve. The mitral valve tissue was cultured on inhibitory mold agar and ultimately grew a Scopulariopsis species with no other microbial growth, including negative bacterial and mycobacterial cultures. Fungal blood cultures were obtained but were negative for growth. Due to the severity of the disease and highly resistant nature of the organism, oral voriconazole dosed at 300 mg twice daily was also added to the antifungal regimen.\nThe day following mitral valve debridement and replacement, vascular medicine and vascular surgery were consulted regarding the suspected mycotic aneurysm and thrombus of the left popliteal artery. CT angiogram with lower extremity runoff was repeated and showed the left popliteal artery mycotic aneurysm and thrombus, as well as bilateral renal infarcts. Ten days after mitral valve surgery, he underwent resection of the popliteal artery and peroneal artery bypass. The pathologic examination revealed GMS-positive staining hyphae, and inhibitory mold agar cultures again grew a pure culture of Scopulariopsis species.\nThe Scopulariopsis species from the cultures was ultimately identified by combined phenotypic characterization and DNA sequencing as Scopulariopsis brevicaulis. Phenotypically, the organism was a tan powdery colony and microscopically demonstrated branching annellides with chaining, round conidia with a truncated base consistent with Scopulariopsis brevicaulis. From a sequencing standpoint, D2 ribosomal sequencing was utilized with the top 3 matches being a greater than 95% match (100%, 99.31%, and 95.45%) to Scopulariopsis species in the Mayo Fungal Library. Antifungal susceptibilities were completed utilizing broth dilution as per recommended guidelines from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute and were consistent with those reported in the literature: amphotericin 2 µg/mL, caspofungin 1 µg/mL, micafungin 0.125 µg/mL, anidulafungin 4 µg/mL, posaconazole 2 µg/mL, voriconazole 8 µg/mL, itraconazole 2 µg/mL, and terbinafine 0.5 µg/mL [].\nLiposomal amphotericin was discontinued after 18 days due to acute renal injury, and caspofungin and oral voriconazole therapy were continued. He completed 8 weeks of combination therapy and was continued on oral voriconazole for chronic suppression. Voriconazole was chosen despite susceptibility data given reported clinical efficacy combined with lack of correlation between the susceptibility data and patient outcomes []. He unfortunately developed peripheral neuropathy, suspected by his local neurologist to be secondary to the voriconazole, and he was transitioned to delayed-release oral posaconazole dosed at 100 mg daily for chronic suppression [, ]. Posaconazole levels were followed and remained therapeutic with levels >1.0 mcg/mL. The inflammatory markers normalized at 6 months. Follow-up TEEs at 3 months and 7 months postoperatively did not show recurrence of endocarditis. Further, after cessation of the voriconazole he reported improvement, but not full resolution, of his neuropathy symptoms. What is the patient's FeverPAIN score?",

    "question": "A 45-year-old male patient arrived at our otorhinolaryngology department for an emergency examination. Owing to the policy of his employing company, he was obliged to self-test for SARS-CoV-2 twice a week. Four hours before his arrival, the patient had attempted to perform a SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test (GenBody Inc, Cheonan, KR) at home by taking an OPS. Upon specimen collection, he felt a mild resistance and had a gag reflex, which resulted in the ingestion of the swab applicator.\nThe patient showed no signs of respiratory distress and had stable vital signs. He showed no apparent regurgitation of saliva. We performed a SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test (Hangzhou Clungene Biotech, CN) by taking an NPS and obtained a negative result.\nDuring routine ear, nose, and throat examination, including flexible rhinopharyngolaryngoscopy, we found no foreign body in the upper respiratory tract or at the pharyngeal level.\nWe performed thoracic and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans in the supine and right lateral recumbent positions. Swab applicators are usually made of nylon. Thus, their radiopacity is not guaranteed without a documented radiopaque marking. In our case, we did not have the manufacturer’s description in hand. To overcome this problem, we asked the patient to drink water to fill the stomach with fluid. After proper windowing, a radiolucent band was visible in the stomach, suggestive of a foreign body (Figure ). No other abnormalities were observable in the imaged regions.\nIn collaboration with the department of gastroenterology, we performed an urgent gastroscopy with a flexible endoscope (Olympus, JP). Despite four hours having elapsed since the incident, we still identified the swab stick intact in the stomach. After firmly catching the object with a polypectomy loop, it was withdrawn and removed safely (Figure ). A second look showed no signs of mucosal damage or any residual foreign bodies along the esophagus and stomach. We examined the foreign body and confirmed that it had been removed without missing parts (Figure ). After eventless observation, the patient was discharged on the same day.\nInformed consent was obtained from the patient for all the procedures and for the publication of information on his clinical course.

The patient complained of resting dyspnea and peripheral pitting edema. She had no prior medical history or family history of cardiovascular disease. On physical examination, her height was 160 cm and body weight was 70 kg. Her blood pressure was 230/145 mm Hg, and her heart rate was 100 beats per minute. Auscultation of the chest revealed a coarse breathing sound with crackling and regular heart beats with no murmur. The liver and spleen were not palpable, and her bowel sounds were normal.\nA blood examination revealed a 7,200/mm3 leukocyte count, 16.5 g/dL hemoglobin, a 274,000/mm3 platelet count, 296 mg/dL random glucose, 8.3% hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), 28 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 1.5 mg/dL creatinine, 7.0 g/dL protein, 3.6 g/dL albumin, 33 IU/L aspartate aminotransferase, 24 IU/L alanine aminotransferase, 292 IU/L alkaline phosphatase, 2.58 mg/L high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, 248 mg/dL total cholesterol, 111 mg/dL triglycerides, 41 mg/dL high density lipoprotein, 181 mg/dL low density lipoprotein, 136 mmol/L sodium, and 4.2 mmol/L potassium. The results of a routine urinalysis were as follows: proteinuria, 2+; glycosuria, 2+; red blood cell, 0 to 1/high power field (HPF) and white blood cell, 5 to 9/HPF; and spot urine protein to creatinine ratio, 428 mg/g. A thyroid function test (TFT) revealed 88 ng/dL T3 (normal range, 78 to 182), 1.44 ng/dL free T4 (normal range, 0.8 to 1.78), and 9.86 mIU/L thyroid stimulating hormone (normal range, 0.17 to 4.05). The TFT results showed subclinical hypothyroidism, but thyroid autoantibodies were negative.\nCardiomegaly was detected on a chest radiograph, and the cardiothoracic ratio was 66% (). The electrocardiogram showed inverted T waves in the lateral and inferior leads, with no significant ST changes. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed LV hypertrophy and severe systolic dysfunction (). The interventricular septal diameter was 1.3 cm, the LV posterior wall diameter was 1.8 cm, the LV internal diameter in diastole was 5.8 cm (normal range, 3.9 to 5.3), the LV internal diameter in systole was 5.1 cm (normal range, 2.1 to 4.0), and the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 25% (). Coronary angiography was performed, and the results were normal.\nThe patient was treated with multiple antihypertensive drugs, including calcium channel blockers, diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and β-blockers to control a hypertensive crisis, but her blood pressure remained >160/100 mm Hg. Abdominal computed tomography was performed to evaluate secondary hypertension, which revealed no abnormalities in either the renal arteries or adrenal glands.\nTo manage diabetes mellitus, she was referred to Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism at Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong. Because the patient had uncontrolled hypertension, newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus, and soft tissue and bone overgrowth, a diagnosis of acromegaly was suspected. Rough and thick skin was observed, and skin tags were noted around the neck. An enlarged jaw and protruded frontal bones were observed, and soft tissue overgrowth of the heel was noted on a lateral view of a foot X-ray (). The basal IGF-1 level was measured as 183.8 ng/mL, which was within the normal range (90 to 360). Acromegaly was diagnosed after performing a 75-g glucose-loading GH suppression test (). In a thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test, GH levels were found to be increased (). MRI of the sella revealed a 5-mm microadenoma on the left side of the pituitary gland (). A combined pituitary stimulation test performed before surgery revealed that both basal and stimulated hormone levels were normal.\nHyperglycemia was treated with 500 mg metformin twice a day and 12 U insulin glargine once a day via subcutaneous injection. We performed a diabetic complication test, and fundoscopy showed severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy ().\nThree weeks after admission, combination antihypertensive therapy caused a reduction in blood pressure to <140/80 mm Hg. A follow-up echocardiogram showed no significant difference in LV hypertrophy, but LVEF was improved to 66% ().\nAfter transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary tumor, the tumor was identified as a GH-secreting adenoma () that showed strong staining with anti-GH antibodies in immunohistochemical analysis ().\nWe performed a follow-up 75-g glucose-loading GH suppression test 2 weeks after surgery, and GH levels were suppressed to 0.15 ng/mL, which means cure state (). The levels of GH and IGF-1 were 0.57, 243.7 ng/mL on postoperative day (POD) 3, 0.38, 295.4 ng/mL on POD 50, and 0.4, 249.5 ng/mL 6 months after surgery (). A follow-up transthoracic echocardiography 6 months after surgery revealed improved LV hypertrophy and LVEF compared with preoperative values.\nThe patient was prescribed calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-receptor blockers.

    "question": "A 31-year-old woman was diagnosed with hypertension by a private clinic in August 2013, based upon a systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg and she was prescribed antihypertensive drugs to treat the condition. Initial therapy consisted of hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg and losartan 50 mg daily. After 1 week, her blood pressure was still high, so the doctor changed her medication to amlodipine 5 mg, losartan 100 mg, and indapamide 2.5 mg per day. Five days after initiating this second regimen of drugs, she developed pretibial pitting edema, and thorough workup was done for the symptom. There were bilateral adrenal masses on abdominal-pelvic computed tomography (CT). Routine blood tests revealed the following: potassium 2.2 mmol/L, plasma renin activity (PRA) 0.12 ng/mL/hr, plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) 16.76 ng/dL, and an aldosterone/renin ratio (PAC/PRA) >30, indicative of primary hyperaldosteronism.\nFollowing her possible diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism, the patient was referred to our hospital for additional testing. At the time of admission, her blood pressure was 155/111 mm Hg, height was 164.5 cm, and weight was 63.5 kg (body mass index, 23.47 kg/m2). Pretibial pitting edemas were detected, but no physical signs of Cushing syndrome were observed.\nA routine blood test at the time of admission showed the following: white blood cell 6,900/µL, hemoglobin 13.5 g/dL, platelet 351,000/µL, total protein 6.9 g/dL, albumin 4.1 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 76 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 126 U/L, blood urea nitrogen 7.3 mg/dL, creatinine 0.71 mg/dL, sodium 141 mmol/L, potassium 2.9 mmol/L, chloride 101 mmol/L, total cholesterol 210 mg/dL, triglyceride 104 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein 50 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein 141 mg/dL, and hemoglobin A1c 5.9%. Biochemical evaluation of pheochromocytoma showed no excessive catecholamine production. The transtubular potassium concentration gradient was 12.64%, suggesting the possibility of hyperaldosteronism or hypercortisolism. PAC and PRA were 24.4 ng/dL and 0.76 ng/mL/hr, respectively, and the PAC/PRA ratio was 32.11 (). After correcting for hypokalemia, a saline loading test was performed, which revealed no suppression of the aldosterone level after saline administration, consistent with a diagnosis of hyperaldosteronism (the basal PAC 24.4 ng/dL increased to 27.3 ng/dL after a 2 L saline infusion). Dexamethasone suppression tests (DSTs) resulted in no suppression of cortisol levels (). Adrenal CT demonstrated two bilateral adrenal masses in each of the adrenal glands, including a 1.6-cm mass on the right and a 2-cm mass on the left adrenal gland (). An adrenal cortical scan using iodine-131-6β-iodomethyl-19-norcholesterol (NP-59) showed focally increased radioactive uptakes in the bilateral adrenal gland areas, with a substantially higher uptake on the left side ().\nBilateral adrenal venous sampling (AVS) with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation () revealed inadequate right adrenal venous blood sampling (right adrenal vein cortisol level/peripheral blood cortisol level [CRt/CP] <10), whereas the cortisol concentration in the left adrenal venous blood showed successful sampling on the left side. One explanation for this difference may be that the low level of CRt was the result of suppressed cortisol secretion due to excessive cortisol secretion from the left adrenal mass. The left adrenal vein aldosterone/cortisol (ALt/CLt) ratio was lower than that of peripheral blood, implying the possibility of suppressed aldosterone secretion from this side caused by a contralateral adrenal mass which might secrete excessive aldosterone []. Four days after the first AVS, a second AVS was performed using low-dose DST but without ACTH infusion (). This time, we also measured the epinephrine levels in the both adrenal veins and peripheral blood; a large peripheral-to-adrenal gradient of epinephrine assured successful catheterization on both sides []. CLt/CP testing confirmed that the left adrenal mass was a cortisol-secreting adenoma [].\nEven though those two AVS results appeared to provide clear evidence of the lateralization of functioning adrenal masses, such an independent functioning of bilateral masses was highly suspicious. We therefore concluded that sequential adrenalectomies, rather than concurrent operations, would be beneficial for making a definitive diagnosis. Moreover, the patient agreed to do sequential operations. The first procedure was a laparoscopic partial adrenalectomy of the right adrenal gland to remove the putative aldosterone-producing mass, with the goal of controlling hypertension and hypokalemia. A firm, 1.5-cm ovoid, well-circumscribed, bright yellow tumor mass lacking necrosis or hemorrhage was arising from the cortex of the adrenal gland in the pathologic specimen. Within 24 hours after surgery, the patient's blood pressure had fallen to 110/80 mm Hg without antihypertensive medication, serum potassium normalized at 4.5 mmol/L, and PAC decreased to 3 ng/dL. These large postoperative changes strongly suggested that the right adrenal adenoma was producing excessive aldosterone. By day 3, an overnight DST continued to show no cortisol suppression, indicating persistent secretion of corticosteroid from the left adrenal mass. To limit the likelihood of subclinical Cushing syndrome progressing to overt Cushing syndrome, we opted to completely remove the left adrenal gland as a means of controlling hypercortisolism. The excised portion of the adrenal mass contained an encapsulated brown solid mass.\nThe patient began taking prednisolone 10 mg once a day for steroid replacement 1 day after the second surgery. By 2 months she had lost 5 kg of body weight. At that time, a rapid ACTH test revealed adrenal insufficiency (). At 16 months after surgery, the patient has gradually reduced her prednisolone intake to 5 mg every other day. Her blood pressure and serum potassium levels have remained within normal ranges, without the need for additional antihypertensive medications or potassium supplements.

    "question": "A 12-year-old White male, who had also been diagnosed with SCD in childhood, sought treatment for a 20-day history of non-productive cough and lower limb oedema, which had evolved to anasarca, together with a new onset of hypertension. He had previously experienced one episode of pain and had undergone one transfusion. He reported no reduction in urine volume and no recent history of skin infection or tonsillitis. On physical examination, he was found to be pallid (+ 3/+ 4) and hypertensive (blood pressure, 160/90 mmHg), with a heart rate of 112 bpm, a respiratory rate of 36 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air.\nBlood tests performed at admission to the emergency room revealed the following: haemoglobin, 5.9 g/dl; haematocrit, 17.8%; haptoglobin, < 10 mg/dl; negative result on the Coombs direct antibody test; reticulocyte fraction, 4.26%; no schistocytes; lactate dehydrogenase, 970 U/L; indirect bilirubin, 0.65 mg/dl; leucocyte count, 17,330 cells/mm3; neutrophil count, 13,100 cells/mm3; lymphocyte count, 1700 cells/mm3; platelet count, 622;000 cells/mm3; and urea, 45 mg/dl. He also showed signs of hyperfiltration, with a serum creatinine concentration of 0.65 mg/dl, and an eGFR, as determined with the Schwartz formula, of 140.0 ml/min/1.73 m2, although no hydroelectrolytic or acid-base disorders were identified. An urine sample obtained at submission was found to contain 20 leucocytes/field and > 100 erythrocytes/field; 24-h proteinuria was 12.5 g. Metabolic analysis of the blood samples showed the following: total proteins, 6.1 g/dl; albumin, 2.6 g/dl; globulins, 3.1 g/dl; total cholesterol, 211 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein, 118 mg/dl; high-density lipoprotein, 66 mg/dl; triglycerides, 133 mg/dl; C4, 25 mg/dl (normal range, 10–38 mg/dl); C3, 106 mg/dl (normal range, 73–149 mg/dl); C-reactive protein, 2.1 mg/dl (normal range, < 5 mg/dl). The serology was negative for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Tests for antinuclear factor, anti-DNA, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were also negative. Serum protein electrophoresis showed hypoalbuminaemia. Blood and urine cultures were negative. A chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly and signs of mild pulmonary congestion. Ultrasound of the kidneys and urinary tract showed that the kidneys were normal in size and appearance.\nThe patient underwent renal biopsy. Light microscopy showed 43 glomeruli with diffuse endocapillary hypercellularity (numerous lymphocytes and neutrophils). Synechiae were observed in 10% of the glomeruli in Bowman’s capsule. There was also occasional splitting of the glomerular basement membrane, as well as overall expansion of the mesangial matrix (Fig. b). There were no changes in the tubules, interstitium or arterioles. Immunofluorescence showed deposition of C3 (2+/3+) and lambda light chains (1+/3+), with a granular pattern, distributed throughout the capillary loop—the so-called “starry sky” pattern—consistent with a diagnosis of APIGN.\nTreatment with a diuretic and an anti-proteinuric agent (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) was instituted, and the patient evolved to clinical improvement, including normalisation of blood pressure and a significant reduction in the level of proteinuria (24-h proteinuria, 1.34 g) after 10 days. Renal function was preserved. The patient left outpatient treatment after 18 months. In the final evaluation, he still presented no proteinuria or haematuria, although the signs of hyperfiltration persisted, his serum creatinine concentration being 0.5 mg/dl and his Schwartz-derived eGFR being 182 ml/min/1.73 m2.

    "question": "A 49-year-old African American male presented to our hospital center after ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation achieved after 10 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation by emergency services. Personal cardiovascular risk factors included untreated hyperlipidemia and hypertension. Cardiac past medical history included one episode of diaphoresis and palpitations, four years prior to this admission. Per the patient, workup at that time at another local hospital revealed an unspecified arrhythmia and cardiac hypertrophy, but the patient did not follow up. The patient denied a family history of recurrent syncope or unexplained cardiac death, but reported unspecified cardiac hypertrophy and unspecified arrhythmia in one brother, and coronary artery disease in mother and brother.\nOn arrival to the emergency department, the patient was asymptomatic. Clinical examination showed a blood pressure of 135/67, with irregular heartbeat of 72 beats per minute, decreased heart sounds and soft systolic murmur but no S4 on cardiac auscultation. Troponin-T was minimally elevated at 0.021 ng/mL. Lipid panel was deranged – cholesterol 239 mg/dL, triglycerides 149 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 170 mg/dL, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 48 mg/dL. Transaminitis (aspartate aminotransferase 504 unit/L, alanine aminotransferase 332 unit/L), elevated creatinine 1.5 mg/dL and anion gap were noted on laboratory studies. Other labs were unremarkable including normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin and thyroid-stimulating hormone.\nSerial 12-lead ECGs showed deep T inversions in V3-V6 and early repolarization in V1 and V2 leads (Figures , ). On arrival, the patient was also in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Figure ), which resolved with intravenous Amiodarone. Septal infarct of undetermined age, possible inferior subendocardial injury, possible anterolateral subendocardial injury, and prolonged QT were also reported on automated interpretation of ECG. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed patent coronary arteries, however, the classic ace of spades sign was seen on ventriculogram (Figure ). Initial transthoracic echocardiogram without contrast was interpreted as normal left ventricular wall thickness, with an ejection fraction of 70% and no wall motion abnormalities.\nThe patient was treated with aspirin 81 mg daily, carvedilol 6.25 mg twice a day, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, and an automated implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) for secondary prevention of another cardiac arrest. The patient was asymptomatic up to discharge three days after admission. Liver function enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) trended down to 65 unit/L and 199 unit/L, respectively. Creatinine also normalized to 1.1 mg/dL.

    "question": "A male patient aged four years and 10 months was brought in with a complaint of short stature. It was indicated that although his development was normal until 12 months of age, it halted afterwards. It was found out that the patient was born at term in breech position through cesarean section with a normal Apgar score and birth weight of 3,750 g, hospitalized postnatally for five days due to birth in breech position and was not noted to be hypothermic and hypoglycemic, was diagnosed with LCP at four years of age following detailed examination due to complaints of pain in the hips, and consequently underwent surgery (). Family history indicated that the patient's parents were related to each other within the second degree of consanguinity. His first sibling was being followed up for Tangier disease, and his second sibling was being followed up for hyperlipidemia by the Department of Pediatric Metabolism. Physical examination findings showed that the patient was prepubertal, and that he had a height of 96 cm (standard deviation score [SDS], -3.2), body weight of 14.6 kg (SDS, -1.9), 2 cm shorter left leg compared to right leg, a surgical scar in the left inguinal region, and stretched penile length of 4.5 cm. Other systemic examination findings were normal. While the patient's chronological age was four years and 10 months, his bone age was consistent with a 2-year-old's (according to Greulich and Pyle).\nLaboratory tests yielded the following results: white blood cell count, 11,300/mm3; hemoglobin, 12.1 g/dL; thrombocyte, 320,000/mm3; urea, 7 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.9 ml/dL; serum sodium, 148 mmol/L; potassium, 4.3 mmol/L; chloride, 102 mmol/L; calcium, 9.7 mg/dL; phosphorus, 4.4 mg/dL; normal liver function; fasting blood glucose, 92 mg/dL; total cholesterol, 130 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein, 41 mg/dL; low density lipoprotein cholesterol, 69 mg/dL; triglyceride, 50 mg/dL; and urine density, 1,022 g/cm3.\nDetailed laboratory analyses showed thyroid function consistent with central hypothyroidism (sT4, 0.49 ng/dL [0.8-1.9 ng/dL]; thyroid-stimulating hormone, 2.57 mU/L [0.5-5 mU/L]). The patient was also determined to have hypocortisolemia (basal serum cortisol level of 2.75 g/dL, stimulated serum cortisol level of 5.71 g/dL [with low-dose adrenocorticotropic hormone]) and GHD (peak GH values in glucagon and levodopa tests while the patient was euthyroid were 0.257 and 0.46 ng/mL, respectively). Serum IGF-1 level was 15 ng/mL (SDS, -3) and Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP3) level was 900 ng/mL (SDS, -2.6). An etiology-oriented hypophyseal magnetic resonance imaging was performed due to high prolactin levels (37.4 ng/mL [normal range, 0-25 ng/mL]), which revealed in the sellar cavity center that the adenohypophyseal gland height was 3 mm, neurohypophyseal localization was abnormal, and that there was no signal intensity. In addition, T1A hyperintense nodular appearance with dimensions of 3 mm×2.5 mm showing diffused homogeneous contrast retention following injection of contrast agent was observed at the median eminence level (ectopic neurohypophysis). The pituitary stalk was not identified as a separate structure (). Considering the patient's medical history, it was deduced and evaluated as a pituitary stalk interruption syndrome due to difficult birth.

In addition, she reported a 3-day history of severe chest pain, together with a productive cough and fever as high as 38 °C. She reported no reduction in urine volume and no recent history of skin infection or tonsillitis. On physical examination, she was found to be very pallid and normotensive (blood pressure, 130/80 mmHg), with a heart rate of 104 bpm, a respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air, as well as being found to have developed anasarca. One month prior, she had undergone outpatient laboratory tests, which had shown that her renal function was normal—with a serum creatinine concentration of 0.75 mg/dl and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), as determined by the Chronic Kidney Disease–Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD–EPI) equation, of 134.9 ml/min/1.73 m2—urine analysis showing no haematuria or proteinuria.\nBlood tests performed at admission to the emergency room revealed the following: haemoglobin, 6.1 g/dl; haematocrit, 18.8%; haptoglobin, < 10 mg/dl; reticulocyte fraction, 6.11%; no schistocytes; lactate dehydrogenase, 433 U/L; indirect bilirubin, 0.36 mg/dl; leucocyte count, 18,820 cells/mm3; neutrophil count, 13,630 cells/mm3; lymphocyte count, 2790 cells/mm3; platelet count, 622;000 cells/mm3; and urea, 29 mg/dl. The patient showed signs of hyperfiltration, including a serum creatinine concentration of 0.49 mg/dl and a CKD–EPI-determined eGFR of 148.5 ml/min/1.73 m2, although no hydroelectrolytic or acid-base disorders were identified. A urine sample was found to contain 100 leucocytes/field and 70 erythrocytes/field. In addition, 24-h proteinuria was 8.99 g. Further analysis of the blood samples showed the following: total proteins, 3.9 g/dl; albumin, 1.2 g/dl; globulins, 2.7 g/dl; total cholesterol, 210 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein, 114 mg/dl; high-density lipoprotein, 37 mg/dl; triglycerides, 205 mg/dl; C4, 26.1 mg/dl (normal range, 10–38 mg/dl); C3, 62 mg/dl (normal range, 73–149 mg/dl); C-reactive protein, 24.9 mg/dl (normal range, < 5 mg/dl). The serology was negative for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. The patient also tested negative for antinuclear factor, anti-DNA, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Serum protein electrophoresis showed hypoalbuminaemia and an anti-streptolysin O level of 816 IU/ml (normal range, < 200 IU/ml). Blood and urine cultures were negative. A chest X-ray showed mild congestion and infiltrate in the right lung base. Ultrasound of the kidneys and urinary tract showed that the kidneys were normal in size and appearance.\nGiven the clinical presentation, the diagnostic hypothesis was pneumonia and anasarca due to nephritic-nephrotic syndrome. The patient was started on ceftriaxone (1 g, twice daily). Computed tomography angiography of the chest ruled out pulmonary thromboembolism and acute chest syndrome, thus indirectly confirming the diagnosis of pneumonia.\nAfter the infection had been controlled, the patient underwent renal biopsy. Light microscopy revealed 7 glomeruli with global endocapillary proliferation; neutrophil and macrophage infiltrate (Fig. a); synechiae in 10% of the glomeruli; occasional splitting of the glomerular basement membrane; and a preserved Bowman’s capsule. The tubules were dilated, with foci of epithelial regeneration and neutrophils within their lumina. There was focal oedema in the interstitium. The interlobular arteries had a normal aspect, with intimal proliferation in the arterioles. Immunofluorescence performed on frozen sections showed intensity of deposition of C3 (2+/3+), IgG (1+/3+), IgA (1+/3+) and lambda light chains (1+/3+), with a granular pattern, distributed diffusely throughout the capillary loop. Collectively, the histological findings were consistent with a diagnosis of APIGN accompanied by microangiopathic changes related to the underlying disease.\nTreatment with a diuretic and an anti-proteinuric agent (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) was instituted, and the patient evolved to clinical improvement (normalisation of blood pressure, as well as resolution of the proteinuria and haematuria). However, the signs of hyperfiltration persisted even after resolution of the proteinuria.

    "question": "A 19-year-old-male presented in May 2007 with swelling of the lower limbs and periorbital puffiness of 2 months’ duration. Evaluation at his primary health centre had revealed albuminuria on dipstick analysis, prompting referral to our institution. He gave no history of recent infections, arthralgia, oral ulcers, cough or haemoptysis. On examination, he had bilateral leg oedema extending up to his knees. The blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, pulse rate was 90 b.p.m. and respiratory rate 14/min. The cardiovascular, abdomen, chest and nervous system examinations were within normal limits. Urinalysis showed 4+ proteinuria, but no erythrocytes or leucocytes. The 24-h urine protein excretion was 6.3 g. The serum creatinine was 71 μmol/L (0.8 mg/dL); serum total protein and albumin were 55 and 17 g/L (5.5 and 1.7 g/dL), respectively, and aspartate and alanine aminotransferases were 12 and 14 IU/L, respectively. Serum cholesterol was 10.4 mmol/L (400 mg/dL), triglyceride 2.8 mmol/L (250 mg/dL), low-density lipoprotein 7.2 mmol/L (280 mg/dL) and high-density lipoprotein 1.3 mmol/L (50 mg/dL). He tested negative for hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-HCV antibody and human immunodeficiency virus I/II. The antinuclear antibody test was negative.\nKidney biopsy (A) revealed 10 glomeruli, which were normal on light microscopy (LM), as were the tubulointerstitial and vascular compartments. Immunofluorescence did not reveal any immune deposits and electron microscopy (EM) showed diffuse foot process effacement.\nA diagnosis of minimal-change disease (MCD) was made and the patient was started on oral prednisolone at 1 mg/kg/day. However, the proteinuria did not show any reduction. At the end of 4 months, the daily urinary protein excretion remained at 5 g. He was deemed to be steroid resistant and treated first with oral cyclophosphamide at 2 mg/kg for 3 months, followed by oral cyclosporine (4 mg/kg/day, average C0 120 ng/mL) and oral prednisolone (0.1 mg/kg/day) for 6 months, mycophenolate mofetil 2 g/day for 6 months and finally a combination of tacrolimus (0.1 mg/kg/day, average Tac C0 7 ng/mL) and oral prednisolone (0.1 mg/kg/day). The nephrotic state persisted throughout this period, with serum albumin <20 g/L (2.0 g/dL) and the serum creatinine 62–80 μmol/L (0.7–0.9 mg/dL) (). During the entire course of his illness, he was continued on supportive therapy with torsemide 10–20 mg twice daily, atorvastatin 20 mg/day and losartan 150 mg/day.\nAt this time, the kidney biopsy was repeated. LM revealed 13 glomeruli, 2 of which showed segmental collapse of the capillary tuft with an overlying crown of podocytes along with synechiae formation, 2 showed segmental endocapillary cellularity with foam cells, 2 were globally sclerosed and the remaining 7 did not show any significant abnormality (B). Tubules showed abundant protein absorption droplets along with patchy tubular atrophy occupying 20% of the biopsy area. Tubules close to the medulla showed marked nucleomegaly along with nuclear smudging associated with tubular necrosis, interstitial oedema and mild-to-moderate patchy plasma cell-rich interstitial inflammation occupying 10% of the biopsy area. Blood vessels were within normal limits. Immunofluorescence was negative for all immunoglobulins, C1q and light chains. EM showed segmental sclerosis with evidence of collapse (C). There was diffuse and extensive foot process effacement, and no reticular aggregates were seen. Ki 67 immunostain showed nuclear positivity in the podocytes of glomeruli showing collapse (D). CD 20 staining was negative. A final diagnosis of CG was made. The patient's serum tested negative by polymerase chain reaction for cytomegalovirus and parvovirus B-19.\nIn view of his resistance to the above therapies and a persistently severe nephrotic state with the biopsy showing many plasma cells, the patient was treated with 4 weekly injections of rituximab (375 mg/m2/dose).

    "question": "A 45-year-old male was admitted to our hospital due to substernal chest discomfort on mild exertion, which occurred three weeks prior to presentation. The frequency and severity of his angina increased over time and the patient described a squeezing chest pain with an onset three days prior to presentation. The past medical history included hypertension, diagnosed three years ago, and smoking history of ten pack-years. There was no family history of coronary artery or hematologic disease. At the time of admission he was on aspirin and anti-hypertensive medications. On physical examination, the blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg and the heart rate was 70 beats per minute. The heart sounds were unremarkable with normal S1 and S2 sounds. The lungs were clear on auscultation. The electrocardiogram showed no ST-segment change, T wave inversion or pathologic Q waves suggestive of myocardial ischemia. No abnormality was found on chest roentgenogram. On complete blood count, the hemoglobin was 13.9 g/dL, white blood cell count was 9,400/L, and the platelet count was 106×104/µL. Electrolytes, renal and liver function tests were not remarkable. Levels of CK-MB and Troponin-T were within normal range. Total serum cholesterol was 161 mg/dL, triglyceride was 95 mg/dL and high-density lipoprotein was 39 mg/dL. Serum homocystein level was 12.7 nmol/mL (reference range 5-15 nmol/mL), and hsCRP was 1.91 mg/L (reference range <3 mg/L). Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and fibrinogen level were within normal range. The iron profile was not remarkable. Bone marrow study showed a hypercellular marrow with markedly increased megakaryocytes, and a normal myeloid/erythroid ratio (). Chromosomal analysis of bone marrow cells revealed a normal 46, XY karyotype with no evidence of bcr/abl rearrangement. Liver and spleen were not enlarged on sonogram images. An elective coronary angiography, two days after admission, showed total occlusion at the mid right coronary artery (RCA) with well-developed collaterals from proximal RCA to PD and PL branches. In addition, there was diffuse irregular, up to 70%, luminal narrowing with haziness noted at the proximal RCA. The left coronary angiography showed a 40% luminal narrowing at the mid left anterior descending artery (LAD). The echocardiography, performed three days after admission, showed no regional wall motion abnormality with about 60% of left ventricular ejection fraction. On color Doppler imaging, there was no significant valvular stenosis or regurgitation noted. There was a relaxational abnormality observed in the diastolic filling pattern. The patient was taking aspirin 100 mg/day, clopidogrel 75 mg/day, atenolol 25 mg/day, diltiazem 90 mg/day and nicorandil 15 mg/day from the day of admission. The chest pain was controlled by medical treatment; therefore, we decided to postpone coronary artery intervention until the platelet count reached a normal level. Treatment with hyroxyurea 500 mg/day and anagrelide HCl 1 mg/day was started as cytostatic therapy. The platelet count was normalized (23×104/µL) five weeks after initiation of cytostatic therapy, and coronary artery intervention was then performed. The totally occluded mid RCA lesion was thought to be a chronic total occlusion because of the presence of good collateral flow from the proximal RCA. We thought that the proximal RCA, stenotic lesion with haziness, resulted from a plaque rupture resulting in an occlusive thrombus, and caused the ischemic symptoms that the patient presented with. Two coronary stents were placed at the proximal and mid RCA. No residual stenosis was observed after the procedure (). The LAD lesion was not treated. The patient was discharged two days after the procedure without any hemorrhagic or thrombotic complication; he remained on aspirin, clopidogrel, hydroxyurea, and anagrelide. The patient was free of symptoms for six months during the follow-up period, and his platelet count remained within normal range. What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

He had been admitted to our hospital 3 times previously due to acute pancreatitis with hyperlipidemia. He had type 2 diabetes mellitus and active pulmonary tuberculosis. He was treated with dietary restriction, daily NPH insulin injection, and lipid lowing medication such as fibrate derivatives. His father was noted to have hypertension, old cerebral infarction and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His mother had hyperlipidemia (type IV) and his elder brother had recurrent acute pancreatitis and diabetes mellitus. He didn't have xanthoma or xanthelasma. He had no alcohol drinking history and no biliary calculus disease. His height was 176 cm and weight was 87 kg, showing marked obesity. On physical examination, his abdomen was slightly distended with hypoactive bowel sounds and he had direct tenderness on epigastrium without rebound tenderness. On admission, laboratory data showed white blood cell count of 15,210/mm3. Blood chemistry tests revealed fasting blood sugar level of 228 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase level of 379 IU/L, and aspartate aminotransferase level of 20 IU/L. The serum amylase level of 160 mg/dL was slightly higher than the normal range (25~125 mg/dL). Serum lipase level was increased to 1596 U/L (normal range of 13~60 U/L). Serum calcium level and blood urea nitrogen level were within normal limits. The lipid profiles such as total cholesterol, triglyceride, high density cholesterol and low density cholesterol were 272 mg/dL, 605 mg/dL, 28 mg/dL and 98 mg/dL, respectively. A diagnosis of type IIb hyperlipoproteinemia was made based on serum lipoprotein electrophoresis [0% of chylomicron (0-2.0), 62.9% of β-lipoprotein (36.5-59.1), 22.5% of pre-β-lipoprotein (3.8-33.8), and 14.6% of α-lipoprotein (20.4-46.4)]. Hemoglobin A1c level was 10.4% and fasting C-peptide and postprandial C-peptide were 2.7 and 3.7 ng/mL, respectively. Abdominal CT scan revealed diffusely enlarged pancreas, peripancreatic fat infiltration and pelvic ascites, which were compatible with acute pancreatitis grade C (). He was treated with dietary restriction, hydration, NPH insulin injection and lipid lowering agents. For the purpose of distinguishing infective pancreatitis from hyperlipidemic pancreatitis, we prescribed antibiotics (2 g of meropenem® per day) for two days until abdominal CT information was obtained. His abdominal pain was resolved within a few days, and white blood cell count was normalized. He was discharged after 8 days, with complete recovery from acute pancreatitis.

The patient took no drugs in the past 6 months. On clinical examination, his pain was reported to be 5/10 according to the visual analogue pain scale, he was afebrile, with a maximum temperature of 36.6°C, and had ortho-arteriotony, with a blood pressure of 128/85 mmHg, and no tachycardia or bradycardia (pulse rate of 66 beats per minute). The patient’s face was bloated, but there was no jugular venous distention, muffled breath sounds, rhonchi or moist rale, the third or fourth heart sound gallop, pericardial rub, peritoneal irritation, hepatosplenomegaly, or leg oedema. Electrocardiogram on admission showed that ST elevated to 0.1–0.2 mv in II, III, aVF, and V4–V6 ().\nInitial abnormal serum laboratory results were as follows: troponin I, 3.499 ug/L; myoglobin, 1200 ug/L; creatine kinase-MB, 69 U/L; creatine kinase, 678 U/L; lactate dehydrogenase, 343 U/L; cholesterol, 6.43 mmol/L; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 5.02 mmol/L; glucose, 2.44 mmol/L; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 0.76 mmol/L; prothrombin time, 10.3 s; activated partial thromboplastin time, 24.5 seconds; serum total protein, 39.1 g/L; albumin, 20.2 g/L; and 24-hour urine protein, 11.054 g/24 hours.\nAccording to the results, our preliminary diagnosis was acute inferior myocardial infarction (Killip grade I) combined with nephrotic syndrome, and we performed a percutaneous intervention procedure, which was followed by 300 mg aspirin and 300 mg clopidogrel orally immediately. During the operation, we saw that the left coronary artery had thickened and the left main artery, left circumflex artery, and right coronary artery were normal. However, there was a great deal of thrombi blocking the anterior and middle anterior descending branch, resulting in 95% stricture () and leading to bloodstream classification at thrombolysis and thrombin inhibition in myocardial infarction grade II. Next, we applied the thrombus suction technique and injected 13 ml of tirofiban to dissolve blood clots. Unfortunately, there was still medium thrombi remaining and 60% stricture in the re-examination of coronary arteriography (). The bloodstream classification at thrombolysis and thrombin inhibition in myocardial infarction grade III. Because the anterior descending branch dilatation made it unsuitable for stent implantation, we had to stop further operation. Next, we gave him a therapeutic regimen of low-molecular-weight heparin for 7 days, 100 mg aspirin per day, and 90 mg ticagrelor twice a day to fight platelet aggregation, and 40 mg atorvastatin per night to remedy hyperlipidaemia persistently.\nOne day after the operation, his postoperative electrocardiogram showed that the elevated ST segments in II, III, aVF, and V4–V6 were down to baseline, and an inverted T wave began to appear in V2–V6 (). An echocardiography performed 3 days after admission showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 48.2%, enlarged bilateral atrium, dilated left ventricle, segmental weak pulse of left ventricular wall, mild regurgitation of bicuspid valve or of tricuspid valve, and the estranged left ventricular cells (). Laboratory tests on the same day showed a higher troponin I of 31.833 ug/L, lower myoglobin of 27.9 ug/L, creatine kinase-MB of 21 U/L, creatine kinase of 74 U/L, and lactate dehydrogenase of 489 U/L. After 4 days, the serum laboratory results showed the following results: troponin I, 6.912 ug/L; myoglobin, 29.5 ug/L; creatine kinase-MB, 17 U/L; creatine kinase, 36 U/L; lactate dehydrogenase, 330 U/L; cholesterol, 2.86 mmol/L; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 1.63 mmol/L; triglyceride, 2.28 mmol/L; and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 0.57 mmol/L. All the related indexes were decreased. On the 14th day after the operation, the patient had a third examination of coronary arteriography, which revealed that there was barely any blockage caused by thrombi in the anterior descending branch and no stricture in the coronary artery ().

    "question": "In January 2014, a 45-year-old Japanese man was referred to our clinic owing to obesity, daytime sleepiness, and snoring during sleep. His Epworth Sleepiness Scale score was 10 points. He underwent overnight diagnostic polysomnography in February 2014. Upon admission, his height was 178.6 cm, weight was 130.7 kg, abdominal circumference was 122 cm, and BMI was 41.0 kg/m2. Physical examination showed that the thyroid gland was not palpable. His serum levels of creatine kinase and creatinine were elevated at 1581 U/L and 1.46 mg/dL, respectively, while his other laboratory results were as follows: aspartate aminotransferase, 57 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 49 U/L; lactate dehydrogenase, 353 U/L; total cholesterol (TC), 335 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 45 mg/dL; triglycerides (TGs), 211 mg/dL; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 248 mg/dL; fasting blood sugar, 86 mg/dL; glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), 6.1 %; thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), >500 μIU/mL; free triiodothyronine, 1.4 pg/mL; free thyroxine, <0.15 ng/dL; thyroid peroxidase antibody, 10 IU/mL; and thyroglobulin antibody, >4000 IU/mL (Table ). Blood samples were evaluated using routine methods at Sapporo Clinical Laboratory Inc. (Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan). Based on these results, indicating hypothyroidism and thyroglobulin antibody positivity, the patient was diagnosed with severe primary hypothyroidism (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis). His dyslipidemia and impaired glucose tolerance were considered as secondary changes due to primary hypothyroidism and obesity. Because polysomnography showed an apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) of 71.2 events/h (normal, <5 events/h) and a minimal SpO2 of 60 %, he also was diagnosed with severe OSA associated with autoimmune hypothyroidism. Therefore, in the beginning of March 2014, nasal CPAP (ICON+Auto, auto-adjusting CPAP; Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Limited, Auckland, New Zealand; minimal pressure, 4.0 cmH2O; maximal pressure, 18.0 cmH2O) and low-dose levothyroxine (12.5 μg/day) were initiated. Upon initiation of the CPAP therapy, the patient was informed that he would have to continue with the CPAP therapy unless his body weight decreased sufficiently.\nIn April 2014, the patient’s body weight had decreased to 125.2 kg, and post-CPAP polysomnography indicated improved OSA (AHI, 2.8 events/h; minimal SpO2, 88 %). A monthly follow-up visit was scheduled to check his body weight and adherence to CPAP. The memory stick of the CPAP machine showed that he used CPAP for an average of 6 h per night, 6 days a week, and that he had an AHI of approximately 2.0 events/h. In the course of gradually increasing the dose of levothyroxine, the patient reportedly felt better and had recovered from his fatigue and lethargy.\nTo address his weight loss as a priority, an LCD was initiated in July 2014 []. Yamada et al. [] reported the benefits of a non-calorie-restricted LCD with the amount of carbohydrates limited to 70–130 g/day for Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. The patient consumed 50 g of white rice per meal in addition to vegetables, fish, eggs, and meat in the morning and at noon; however, he did not eat rice, noodles, or other carbohydrates at night. In February 2015, the dose of 175 μg/day levothyroxine appeared to maintain a euthyroid state (TSH, 0.75 μIU/mL), and his other laboratory results were within normal limits, including an HbA1c level of 5.3 %, TC level of 194 mg/dL, and TG level of 89 mg/dL.\nFinally, in July 2015, the patient’s body weight reached 98.3 kg, a reduction of 32.4 kg (25 % of his initial body weight), while his BMI decreased from 41.0 to 30.8 kg/m2. Figure shows changes in his body weight and TSH level over time. The patient felt motivated by the prospect of discontinuing the CPAP therapy, and was encouraged by the consistent weight loss at the monthly clinical visits. He also wanted to continue with the LCD because he did not find it difficult. What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration? Please outuput your answer in terms of mg/dL.",

Menarche occurred 1 year prior and her menstrual cycles were regular.\nOn admission, the patient’s height was 158.9 cm (25–50th percentile), weight was 75.5 kg (>97th percentile), and BMI was 29.9 kg/m2 (>97th percentile) (). Her vital signs were within the normal range with a blood pressure of 112/68 mmHg, pulse of 72 beats/min, respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, and temperature of 36.6°C. She had a clear mental status, warm skin, and moist mucous membranes. A chest examination revealed no specific findings, while an abdominal examination revealed no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nLaboratory tests at the time of admission revealed an HbA1c level of 9.9%, fasting blood glucose level of 202 mg/dL, insulin level of 15.85 μIU/mL, and C-peptide level of 2.97 ng/mL. Liver function tests showed an elevated AST level at 47 IU/L and ALT level at 69 IU/L. A lipid panel and comprehensive metabolic panel showed a total cholesterol level of 165 mg/dL, triglyceride level of 104 mg/dL, HDL-C of 50 mg/dL, total protein of 7.6 g/dL, and albumin of 4.8 g/dL (). The free fatty acid level was elevated at 671 μEq/L.\nThere were no significant findings on a chest radiograph. An abdominal ultrasound showed moderate fatty liver.\nFor glycemic control, combination therapy of oral medication (metformin 500 mg BID) and lifestyle modification through adjustments in dietary habits was prescribed. We evaluated her dietary and nutritional knowledge and then counseled her to consume regular meals with 70–90 g of protein per day, maintain daily nutritional requirements of approximately 1800 kcal, and eat a low-carb, low-fat diet. She was recommended to modify her habitual preference of salty and spicy foods, reduce her salt intake, track her meals, and attend outpatient monitoring appointments every 1–2 months.\nFor an exercise program, she was instructed to include aerobic and weight exercises that improve muscle strength. She was advised to walk >1 hour at least 5 days per week and visit a health training center for ≥1 hour of strength exercises at least 3 times per week. We measured her height and weight every 2 months, and used InBody720, a type of BIA for accurate assessment of obesity.

    "question": "In December 2020, a 51-year-old non-obese Japanese man presented to the Diabetes Care Center at Jinnouchi Hospital in Kumamoto, Japan, because of the suspicion of T2DM with hyperglycemia by an annual health screening (fasting glucose; 164 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c); 8.8 %). He was initially pointed out his hyperglycemia at fasting condition by a health screening three years ago (fasting glucose; 140 mg/dL, HbA1c; 7.6 %) but he did not go to the hospital because he had no symptoms and did not recognize his own disease severity. He was an office worker and did not have a habit of excessive soft drink intake, and an unbalanced diet caused zinc deficiency. He was a current smoker (10 cigarettes/day) and had a daily drinking habit (30 g of alcohol/day). He did not have an active exercise habit. He did not have a family history of T2DM, cardiovascular disease, or any habitual medications.\nAt his first visit to our outpatient service, clinical examination showed a body height of 168.1 cm, bodyweight of 62.2 kg, body mass index (BMI) of 22.2 kg/m2 (non-obese), blood pressure of 150/79 mmHg (hypertension), and regular pulse rate of 77 beats/min. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities. Laboratory examination showed hyperglycemia (fasting blood glucose concentration, 172 mg/dL); elevated concentration of HbA1c (8.5 %) with normoinsulinemia (4.2 μU/mL; normal rage: 2.2~12.4 μU/mL), high total cholesterol (248 mg/dL), and high triglyceride (342 mg/dL); and a reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (39 mg/dL) (Table ).\nHe did not have diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, thyroid dysfunction, or adrenal abnormality. He was non-obese but not salcopenic, and he had no evidence of excess fat accumulation assessed by bioelectrical impedance analyzer [] and abdominal computed tomography (Table ).\nWe performed 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test (75g-OGTT) and we found the well-maintained basal insulin secretion without hyperinsulinemia, prolonged hyperglycemia, and poor elevating insulin response to glucose load (Table ).\nBased on the results of blood insulin levels in 75g-OGTT, we possibly speculated the presence of pancreatic β-cell dysfunction as his primary pathogenic cause of diabetes (Table ).\nThree weeks after his first visit, he was admitted to our hospital for assessment and treatment of his hyperglycemia. We found that his antibody titer to glutamic acid decarboxylase was undetectable (<5.0 U/mL) and his daily urinary C-peptide immunoreactivity (CPR) excretion was unexpectedly accelerated at 182.07 µg/day, thus establishing a definitive diagnosis of T2DM (Table ).\nAfter admission, we provided the hospitalized dietary (1800 Kcal/day) and exercise therapies according to our standard protocol []. On the second day of hospitalization (before treatment), his blood glucose levels were still elevated under the optimal dietary therapy (Table ).\nOn the third day of hospitalization, a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp examination [] revealed no insulin resistance (M-value>8.0), enhanced insulin sensitivity (M/I>12.0), and elevated insulin clearance assessed by the metabolic clearance rate of insulin (MCRI>500) (Table ).\nWe also found the strongly increased hepatic insulin clearance assessed by the molar ratio of CPR/insulin at fasting condition (Table ). Abdominal computed tomography showed normal subcutaneous and abdominal fat deposition and normal hepatic fat accumulation as assessed by the liver-to-spleen attenuation ratio (Table ). His pathogenic condition of abnormal glucose-metabolism suggested the possibility of attenuated insulin actions by the elevated insulin clearance but neither pancreatic β-cell dysfunction nor insulin resistance.\nBecause of the preserved capacity of endogenous insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells and the absence of insulin resistance, the patient initially received lifestyle modification therapy with stopping smoking and drinking, taking adequate calorie intake, reducing salt intake, and introducing an exercise habit during the hospitalized treatments []. He also received an explanation for his diabetic conditions and his novel pathogenesis of hyperglycemia with elevated insulin clearance. Because we have no established and evidence-based interventional strategies to treat his elevated insulin clearance, we started to treat him with metformin (initial dose of 500 mg/day and maintenance dose of 1000 mg/day) and followed up his hyperglycemia. His hyperglycemia was not life-threatening at the time of hospital admission (no ketosis and no symptom), and dietary therapy and metformin were effective for his hyperglycemia. During the hospitalized therapy, we measured fasting blood glucose levels every morning and measured the daily blood glucose profile. At the same time, we started statin (rosuvastatin; 5 mg/day), fibrate (fenofibrate; 160 mg/day), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril; 5 mg/day) to treat his hyperlipidemia and hypertension, and we subsequently added ezetimibe 10 mg/day and α-glycosidase inhibitor (voglibose; 0.9 mg/day). On the fourteenth day of hospitalization, his blood glucose concentration and blood pressure (blood pressure; 119/71 mmHg) were well-controlled (Table ). We finally found a decrease in daily urinary CPR excretion (103.75 µg/day) and blood insulin level (1.8 μU/mL) as compared to the pre-treatment condition. His elevated hepatic insulin clearance was not rapidly changed after the two weeks of hospital therapies (molar ratio of CPR/insulin at fasting condition; 41.8). After 17 days of in-hospital therapies and education, the patient was discharged with the recommendation to continue appropriate dietary therapy (1800 kcal/day as described above) and at least 30 minutes of daily exercise. The patient continued treatment with all the medications described above and underwent monthly outpatient follow-ups.\nAfter discharge, we followed him at our outpatient service as usual [], which led to an improvement in his blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) concentrations. In March 2021, his blood glucose, blood pressure, and lipid parameters have been well managed at our outpatient service (fasting glucose; 117 mg/dL, and HbA1c; 6.6 %, blood pressure; 112/71 mmHg, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; 59 mg/dL, and triglyceride; 75 mg/dL). We want to re-perform the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp examination to evaluate insulin clearance and insulin sensitivity at our outpatient service after 12 months of treatment or after glycemic control had been improved. We are not sure whether we will be able to re-evaluate the elevated insulin clearance in the future. What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

Physical examination revealed a pain in the neck and a 1 cm nodule in the thyroid isthmus on palpation. Moreover, the breath sounds were decreased in the right lung. Laboratory tests were as follows: white blood cell: 3800/mm3, hemoglobin: 12.6 g/dL, platelet: 159,000/L, C-reactive protein (CRP): 25 mg/L (normal, 0 to 1 mg/dL), glucose: 90, urea: 47, creatinine: 1.07 mg/dL (0.84–1.25), aspartate transaminase (AST): 26 U/L (8–40), alanine transaminase (ALT): 43 U/L (5–35), sodium: 139 mmol/L (136–146), potassium: 4.7 mmol/L (2.5–4.5), triglyceride: 342 mg/dL (35–150), HDL: 35 mg/dL (40–60), total cholesterol: 302 mg/dL (120–200), and sedimentation: 76/h. The cardiothoracic ratio was increased on the PA-AC graph. Pericardial effusion was detected during the consultations with the relevant departments. During the investigation of the etiology of the pericardial effusion, nephrotic-range proteinuria (3.6 gr/day) was detected. Subcutaneous biopsy was performed on suspicion of amyloidosis in the etiology of proteinuria but no sign of amyloidosis was found in the immunohistochemical analysis. Duodenal and rectal mucosal biopsies were performed but amyloid was detected only in the rectal mucosa. The presence of amyloid was confirmed by the appearance of Congo Red and apple-green birefringence and immunohistochemical staining patterns. Thyroid function tests were as follows: Ft3: 2.14 pg/mL (normal, 2.5 to 3.9 pg/mL), Ft4: 1.01 ng/dL (0.61–1.12), TSH: 0.29 μIU/mL (0.34–4.2), anti-thyroid peroxidase (Anti-TPO): 28 IU/mL (0–35), and antithyroglobulin (AntiTG): 110 IU/mL (0–115). On ultrasonography, both thyroid parenchymata were heterogeneous, whereas a 12 × 8 mm heterogeneous, degenerated, mixed nodule was detected in the isthmus and a 13 × 8 mm cystic nodule was detected in the inferior segment of the right lobe. Thyroid scintigraphy revealed low thyroid activity and increased background activity in the thyroid area. Fine needle aspiration of the thyroid gland revealed a 12 × 8 mm mixed nodule with benign cytological results in the isthmus and an 18 mm cystic nodule at the junction of the left lobe with the isthmus. Thyroid scintigraphy was normal. In the follow-up period, total thyroidectomy was performed due to euthyroidism. Pathological analysis revealed amyloid deposition in the entire thyroid gland and deposition of amorphous eosinophilic material between the follicular structures. Amyloid was histochemically stained with PAS and Congo Red stains and was immunohistochemically classified as AA (Figures , , and ).

    "question": "Case 1 is a 47-year-old male who recalls gradually worsening illness starting around the age of 25 that he partially attributes to poor food choices and opioid use. By the age of 36, he recalls knowing that he had “undeniable, serious illness,” and by the age of 38, he weighed over 400 pounds and suffered from severe sleep apnea, asthma and trouble breathing, eczema, allergies, hypertension (SBP/DBP = 255/155 on 2 medications), high total cholesterol (300 mg/dL), high triglycerides (279 mg/dL), and chronic shoulder and joint pain. He had difficulty moving and completing basic activities of daily living, such as putting on his shoes. He was on a number of medications that cost him approximately USD 7680 out of pocket, annually, while his insurance company paid a total of USD 19,646 for medications in 2009 alone. In addition to seeing a physician at least once every 1–2 weeks for his various conditions, he attended monthly appointments to aspirate fluid from his knees, had multiple visits to the ER, underwent shoulder surgery, and had one ankle reconstruction surgery with a second one imminent. Around 2012, at the age of 38, he decided to pursue gastric bypass surgery; however, his physician did not clear him to undergo the procedure, due to his poor underlying health. This event, combined with the recent deaths of two close family members, is what ultimately prompted him to begin considering lifestyle changes to improve his health. Initially, his approach to change was “going one step further than the day before.” First, he forced himself to simply get up from his chair once, and then twice per day, and then he progressed to being able to go on walks and walk up the stairs. He began researching additional lifestyle changes and watched documentaries, such as Forks Over Knives, which he describes as providing an entirely new perspective on food. He adopted dietary changes that began with a green juice fast followed by calorie restrictions, reducing red meat, and changing from full to lower fat dairy. On 1 January 2013, he adopted a strict, whole-food, plant-based (WFPB) dietary pattern. Thus, what started initially as a set of small lifestyle changes ultimately fostered a completely new lifestyle approach—one where fitness and plant-based eating were the focus. Approximately 6 months into the lifestyle change, Case 1 had lost 150–200 pounds, and although he does not recall his exact numbers, his cholesterol was cut in half, and triglyceride levels were in the normal range. By 2015, his cholesterol was 112 mg/dL and triglycerides were 74 mg/dL. In just 3–4 years, he went from barely standing up from a chair to running his first marathon in May 2016; by 2017, he was completing Ironman competitions and later ran an ultra-marathon. His current laboratory values as of 20 May 2021 include a total cholesterol of 103 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 36 mg/dL, triglycerides 61 mg/dL, non-HDL cholesterol 67 mg/dL, and blood pressure 122/78. Post lifestyle change, he also notes significant improvement in his level of happiness and quality of life, specifically with respect to being able to enjoy time with his family, traveling, and gaining a new outlook on life.\nAside from the possibility of gastric bypass surgery (USD 18,000–35,000) [], Case 1 was a candidate for a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machine for obstructive sleep apnea (USD 1000–3000) [] and a Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator (TENS) machine for pain management (approximately USD 100–500) [] prior to his lifestyle change, highlighting an approximate average savings of USD 28,800 in discreet medical costs potentially avoided. Post lifestyle change, he reports spending only USD 61 per year on medications (B12 injections), as opposed to his previous approximated average spending of USD 7600+ in annual medication costs. Pharmaceutical costs covered by his insurance company decreased from USD 19,000+ in 2009 to USD 122.24 in 2015 and 2016 combined. In addition, his grocery costs are approximately half of what they were prior to his lifestyle change. What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

    "question": "A 22-year-old female was admitted to our hospital with the chief complaint of heavy menstrual bleeding for 10 days. Blood loss was severe, requiring around 4–5 tampon changes per day, and she complained of feeling dizzy and weak. She was unmarried and had no history of similar menorrhagia.\nAbout 10 months earlier she had prolonged menstrual bleeding at that time, but as the menstrual cycle was normal and the bleeding was not very severe, she had not sought gynecological advice. About 3 weeks earlier she had experienced generalized muscle aches and joint pains (especially involving the upper and lower extremities), along with low-grade fever and bleeding from the gums. She had visited a primary healthcare center, where laboratory examination showed thrombocytopenia (50,000 dL) and anemia (6.5 g/dL). Dengue fever was suspected, and she was given a blood transfusion.\nAt our hospital she was initially admitted to the obstetrics and gynecology emergency department because of the severe menstrual bleeding. However, after ultrasound examination ruled out gynecological abnormalities, she was referred to the internal medicine department. On examination, her vital signs were within normal limits, but the conjunctiva was pale, and her hair showed a tendency to fall out easily. Multiple erythematous macules were present on the skin; however, there was no “butterfly rash” on the face. Systemic examination was otherwise normal.\nHemogram showed the following: hemoglobin 11.3 g/dL; hematocrit 36%; MCV 76.4 fL; MCHC 31.4 g/dL; serum iron 45 µg/dL; TIBC 279 µg/dL; transferrin saturation 16%; thrombocyte count 55,200/dL; and leucocyte count 7,310/dL (with normal differential count). Kidney function tests showed normal serum urea and creatinine levels, with eGFR of 129.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 (calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation). The random blood glucose level was 105 mg/dL. The lipid profile showed total cholesterol, 218 mg/dL; low-density lipoprotein 161 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein 27 mg/dL; and triglyceride 150 mg/dL. Liver function tests and serum electrolyte levels were within normal limits. Coagulation function tests showed partial thromboplastin time 9.7 s (11.3); activated partial thromboplastin time 31.8 s (34.7); fibrinogen level 429.9 mg/dL; and D-dimer 0.2 mg/dL. Antinuclear antibody was positive at a titer of 1/1,000, with C3 86.4 mg/dL, C4 15.4 mg/dL, CRP 2.4 mg/dL, and anti-dsDNA 614.5 IU/mL. Lactic acid dehydrogenase was 464 U/L, reticulocyte count 1.42%, immature platelet fraction 6.7%, and serum albumin 3.87 g/dL. Urinalysis showed a large number of erythrocytes, epithelial cells, and amorphous crystals. Proteinuria was present (2+). Total 24-h protein excretion was 1,148 mg. Kidney ultrasound examination was done as a part of routine examination, which revealed bilateral dilatation of the pelvicalyceal systems showing hydronephrosis grade 1 on the left kidney (Fig. ) and grade 2 on the right kidney (Fig. ) without evidence of kidney cyst or stones. Moreover, ultrasound examination on the urinary bladder shows an increased bladder wall thickness (Fig. ).\nBased on these findings, we diagnosed SLE complicated by lupus nephritis and lupus cystitis. Treatment was started with intravenous methylprednisolone (62.5 mg/day; 1.5 mg/kg/day). The vaginal bleeding stopped within 2 days, and the patient's general condition improved. Laboratory parameters also showed good response to corticosteroid therapy. After 5 days of intravenous therapy, the patient was switched to oral methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg/day). She was discharged from hospital on the 8th day, with the advice to continue methylprednisolone at the same dose and she is scheduled for follow-up after 1 month.

Two years prior, she was diagnosed with MDS of the refractory anemia with excess blasts-2 subtype, according to World Health Organization classification. The International Prognostic Scoring System score was 3 and classified as high risk group. Following induction chemotherapy with azacitidine until the 16th cycle, the patient achieved complete remission. Chromosome analysis showed hyperdiploid clone with complex karyotypic abnormalities including trisomy 8 (55,XX, +1, +4, del(5)(q13), +6, +8, +9, +10, +14, +21, +22[17]/46, XX[3]).\nThe patient had been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM) 2 years previously. Serum glucose level was controlled without complications such as diabetic retinopathy or nephropathy including microalbuminuria.\nLaboratory test revealed pancytopenia (hemoglobin concentration, 6.0 g/dL; white blood cell count, 2.25×109/L; platelet count, 12×109/L); slightly abnormal serum lipid profile (total cholesterol, 213 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein, 26 mg/dL; triglyceride, 284 mg/dL); normal prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time; and elevated levels of fibrinogen, fibrin degradation product and D-dimer. Thrombolytic therapy and antiplatelet drugs were contraindicated due to thrombocytopenia. Electrocardiography and echocardiography showed no abnormal result.\nOn physical examination, the patient was alert and hemodynamically stable. Her initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 6 (facial palsy 1, right arm motor 4, dysarthria 1). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed scattered acute infarction in the left cerebral deep white matter near primary motor cortex-white matter junction, corona radiata, and angular gyrus. Brain magnetic resonance angiography indicated severe stenosis and/or acute thrombosis of left proximal M1. And, perfusion MRI showed abnormal perfusion with delayed mean transit time (, , ).\nOn the third day of admission, she underwent rehabilitation consult. Manual muscle strength test (MMT) of right arm was grade 1 proximally and grade 0 at wrist; and the strength of right leg was grade 3 at whole lower limb. The patient scored 40 on the Korean version of Modified Barthel Index, suggesting total dependency of activities of daily living (ADL), and exhibited anomic aphasia. On the 27th day of admission, the patient was unable to open her right eye. The result of follow-up MMT was grade 0 at right whole upper limb, grade 1 at right hip and knee, and grade 2 at right ankle. Further radiologic study was not done despite possibility of progression. During the hospitalization period, conservative treatments alone were administered including intravenous hydration, transfusion, antibiotics for the recurrent infection, and bedside rehabilitative therapy. Additional chemotherapy was not possible because of poor general condition. On the 44th day of admission, the patient was transferred to a secondary referral hospital. On the day of discharge, her NIHSS score was 10 (facial palsy 2, right arm motor 3, right leg motor 2, limb ataxia 1, sensory 1, dysarthria 1), which was increased from that on admission.

    "question": "A 53-year-old female presented to our hospital complaining of a 6-month history of backache. Judging from the blood testing results, she had hypercalcemia, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was increased to 1,253 U/L (normal range, 35 to 130); the patient was sent to the endocrinology department. Her past history was significant for a surgical procedure for fibrocystoma of her right humerus 20 years ago, and she had donated one of her kidneys to a relative 7 years previously. She had taken atorvastatin 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, and omega-3 fatty acid 1,000 mg daily for the past 3 years to treat high blood pressure and dyslipidemia. The patient had been misdiagnosed with a thyroid nodule and hypothyroidism at another hospital 4 years previously and had immediately been prescribed levothyroxine 50 µg/day. At that time, the thyroid ultrasonography revealed two nodules that were 0.3 and 0.5 cm in diameter on her right lobe and another nodule that was 2.3×1.3 cm in size that was projected backwards. She had fine needle aspiration cytology for the nodule on the left lobe, and this had revealed a benign nodule. She had been followed up every 6 months by neck ultrasonography. Two years later, when the nodule on the left lobe of the thyroid had increased in size to 2.9×1.7 cm, they carried out radiofrequency ablation. However, the thyroid nodule remained the same size even after the radiofrequency ablation, so they monitored its size every 6 months for 2 more years (). During that time, the patient began experiencing backache and visited the orthopedics department of our hospital where she was suspected of having metabolic bone disease due to the high serum ALP value.\nThe patient presented with generalized weakness and fatigue without other hypercalcemic symptoms. The peripheral blood examination was as follows: leukocyte count, 7,020/mm3; hemoglobin, 9.3 g/dL; platelet count, 249,000/mm3; prothrombin time (PT), 14.4 seconds (normal range, 11.9 to 14.3); activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), 31.3 seconds (normal range, 29.1 to 43.5); serum iron, 65 µg/dL (normal range, 40 to 160); total iron binding capacity (TIBC), 258 µg/dL (normal range, 230 to 430); transferrin saturation, 25%; and ferritin, 158.6 ng/mL (normal range, 13 to 150). Serum chemistry values were also obtained: blood urea nitrogen, 26.9 mg/dL; creatinine, 1.98 mg/dL; glucose, 110 mg/dL; ALP, 1,011 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase, 23 U/L; and alanine aminotransferase, 11 U/L. Serum calcium was 14.6 mg/dL, phosphate was 3.5 mg/dL, and ionized calcium was 7.2 mg/dL. Serum protein and serum albumin were 6.9 and 3.7 g/dL, respectively. The results of the serum electrolyte test revealed that sodium was 135.7 mmol/L, potassium was 4.3 mmol/L, chloride was 104.0 mmol/L, and serum osmotic pressure was 286 mOsm/kg. According to the serum lipid examination, the total cholesterol was 146 mg/dL, triglyceride was 95 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein was 33 mg/dL, and low density lipoprotein was 79 mg/dL. A thyroid function test found T3 was 108.9 ng/dL (normal range, 80 to 200), thyroid stimulating hormone was 0.40 mIU/L (normal range, 0.27 to 4.2), and free T4 was 0.74 ng/dL (normal range, 0.93 to 1.70). Under dual energy X-ray absorptiometry-based bone density examination, the T-score of the lumbar region was -1.4, while the T-scores of the neck were -1.2 on the left and -1.8 on the right. Except for the fifth lumbar vertebra, which had spondylolisthesis, nothing remarkable was found on magnetic resonance imaging.\nAccording to further blood tests, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 was 9.6 ng/mL (normal range, 4.8 to 52.8), and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was 10.5 pg/mL (normal range, 19.6 to 54.3), while the intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) was 1,911 pg/mL (normal range, 15 to 65). When we performed bone scanning with 99mTc, the amount of cortical bone radioactive isotope uptake increased very high (). Because we suspected hyperparathyroidism, we carried out a 99mTc sestamibi scan and suspected the lesion that had been previously diagnosed as a left thyroid nodule was likely a parathyroid adenoma (). Using thyroid Doppler ultrasonography, we discovered a hypervascular adenoma that was 5-cm-sized solid mass with similar echo of surrounding thyroid tissue in the center, and slightly low echo in outer part in the inferior site of left thyroid gland (), while on the right thyroid parenchyma we discovered two thyroid nodules, 0.3 and 0.5 cm each in diameter, that the patient had had 4 years before. We performed neck computed tomography and found there was no neck lymph node metastastasis and local invasion of other organs ().\nThe patient received both hydration and diuretic treatments until she underwent a surgical operation to control the hypercalcemia; she also had pamidronate 90 mg intravenous injections twice a week. On the 11th day after hydration and diuretic treatment, her condition had improved; serum calcium was reduced to 11.6 mg/dL, and creatinine improved to 1.11 mg/dL. On the 12th day, the patient had left parathyroid excision and was diagnosed with a parathyroid adenoma (). Following the surgical procedure, iPTH normalized to 42.5 pg/mL, but calcium and vitamin D were prescribed for 9 months to cure the hypocalcemia that had developed due to hungry bone syndrome. It has been a year since the surgical operation, and her calcium, phosphate, ALP, and iPTH all remain at normal levels. What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

    "question": "A 33-year-old male with a significant medical history of hypertension and smoking presented to outpatient department with complaints of left-sided chest pain, SOB and episodic cough. The pain was moderate to severe in intensity, radiating to left arm and neck, continuous in nature, aggravated with movements with no relieving factors. It was not associated with fever, headache, vomiting or abdominal symptoms. The SOB was mostly experienced on walking and occasionally when lying flat. His family history was positive for cardiovascular disease as his father had fatal MI at a young age.\nPast medical records depicted that he was admitted to a local hospital in 2014 with a diagnosis of right-sided weakness secondary to cerebrovascular accielectrocardiogram dent. The magnetic resonance imaging scans of brain showed an acute infarction of area supplied by the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). Magnetic resonance angiography of the circle of Willis depicted occlusion of the left MCA at the horizontal M1 segment. The extracranial arteries did not show any abnormalities like plaque formation on evaluation by cervical echography. After initial management with intravenous (IV) aspirin, the patient was administered with IV clopidogrel. Long-term anticoagulation was not prescribed since no cause was identified. There were no complications and the patient’s hemiparesis gradually improved during the following months. Later in 2017, he developed SOB with acute retrosternal chest pain. His electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in leads V2-V4. Troponin T was raised up to 7,120 ng/L [normal (N)= 0-14]. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed moderate left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, concentric LV hypertrophy, regional wall motion abnormities and mild mitral regurgitation (Figure ). The patient was initially administered with xylocaine, heparin, nitroglycerine, atropine, metoprolol, clopidogrel and loop diuretics. Cardiac catheterization revealed total occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery for which the patient underwent primary angioplasty to LAD with a drug-eluting stent. After adequate management, the patient was discharged on aspirin, clopidogrel, bisoprolol, rosuvastatin, spironolactone, hydroxyzine and loop diuretics.\nOn examination, his blood pressure (BP) was 165/90 mmHg, respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute and heart rate was 70 beats per minute with no arrhythmia. General physical examination revealed palmar erythema, splinter hemorrhages and mild pedal edema. The SOB of New York Heart Association class III along with orthopnea was accompanied by productive cough and hemoptysis. Apex beat could not be palpated while lung fields were found to be clear on auscultation. Neurological examination showed no focal neurological deficits with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15/15. Other systemic examinations were insignificant.\nLaboratory evaluation on admission revealed hemoglobin of 14.5 g/dL (N=13.8-17.2), total leukocyte count of 7 x 109/L (N=4-11), platelet count of 249 x 109/L (N=150-400), prothrombin time of 10.7 seconds (N=11-13.5), activated partial thromboplastin time of 16.7 seconds (N=26-36) and international normalized ratio of 1.10 (N≤ 1.1). Serum electrolytes were normal, and creatinine was documented to be 0.8 mg/dL (N=0.6-1.2). Total bilirubin, albumin and globulin levels were within the normal range. Lipid profile was also normal with serum cholesterol of 114 mg/dL (N< 200), low-density lipoprotein of 55 mg/dL (N=60-130), high-density lipoprotein of 60 mg/dL (N=60), and triglyceride level of 75 mg/dL (N<150). However troponin I levels were raised up to 0.1 ng/mL (N≤ 0.04).\nThe initial ECG had 1-2 mm ST-segment elevation in leads I, V2-V5 and aVL with ST-segment depression in reciprocal leads (Figure ). Chest X-ray showed an enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with diffuse pulmonary edema (Figure ). The patient was initially managed with ascard, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, valsartan, bisoprolol, spironolactone,and omeprazole.\nTTE showed dilated LV with moderate dysfunction, akinetic LV apex, apical mid interventricular septum and inferior wall, and an ejection fraction (EF) of 35%. Carotid Doppler and duplex study of neck vessels (common carotid, external carotid, internal carotid and vertebral arteries) were found to be normal. Cardiac catheterization revealed a patent stent and thrombotic occlusion of the LAD. Considering the past history of stroke and MI in this young patient, blood samples were sent for a detailed coagulation profile. The serum homocysteine level was found to be 10 µmol/L (N=4-15), while factor V Leiden was also negative. Deficiency of PC and PS was finally diagnosed; values seen were 41.9% (N=70-123) and 53% (N=70-140), respectively.\nAlthough the patient recovered from SOB and pedal edema, the EF showed no improvement despite adequate antiplatelet therapy. The BP also dropped to 100/70 mmHg. The patient was discharged with anticoagulants, diuretics, beta-blockers and nitrates. The patient was advised for regular follow-ups, but unfortunately, he could not maintain follow-ups. What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

On admission, his vital signs were a blood pressure of 144/83 mmHg, heart rate of 74 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 50 breaths per minute, O2 saturation of 40% (room air), and temperature of 38 °C. On physical examination, he was found to be febrile, somnolent, and polypneic, with marked respiratory effort. Emergency orotracheal intubation and transfer to the intensive care unit were necessary.\nInitial screening showed thrombocytopenia (platelet count 138 × 103 cells/µl), leukocytosis (WBC 15,760 cells/ml, 90% neutrophils) with lymphopenia (6.20% lymphocytes), elevated transaminases (ALT 1507.4 IU and AST 3049.7 IU), elevated d-dimer (44,066 µg/ml), and negative RT-PCR SARS CoV-2 test. Chest X-ray showed extensive interstitial infiltrates in both lung fields (Fig. b). Considering the progressive decrease in total platelet count as well as gradual lymphopenia (Fig. ), a dengue IgM/IgG test was conducted and was positive, while the dengue PCR-RT test was negative. According to radiographic findings and respiratory involvement, the RT-PCR test for SARS CoV-2 was repeated on two more occasions, with negative results. Therefore, IgG antibodies for SARS CoV-2 were assayed and were positive.\nPositive serology for both SARS CoV-2 and dengue virus confirmed coinfection, so it was considered that he had probably entered a late stage of the disease. Steroid management was indicated according to COVID-19 management guidelines, in addition to pronation cycles, to which he presented poor response and persistent hypoxemia. During his stay in intensive care, he presented multiple complications, such as acute pulmonary embolism, with signs of secondary thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, bacterial superinfection in his lungs by Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Akin III acute renal failure. Computerized tomography angiography of the chest was performed, which confirmed acute pulmonary thromboembolism of multiple bilateral lobar and segmental bilateral branches with signs of secondary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary changes suggestive of organizing pneumonia secondary to viral infection (Fig. ). Details of the clinical description of the coinfection are presented in Table . The patient remained in the ICU for COVID-19, bacterial superinfection, and dengue with alarm signs for 63 days. His progression was slow, showing progressive clinical deterioration. He required prolonged mechanical ventilation and vasopressor management until he finally died.

Nine days prior to admission, her daughter returned from another European country and 3 days thereafter the daughter developed upper airways symptoms. The next day (day 0), the patient developed fatigue and unspecific body discomfort, with no airway symptoms. COVID-19 was confirmed in both the next days. Her medical condition improved temporarily until hospitalisation on day 7 due to several episodes of near-syncope and increased body and chest discomfort.\nBy admittance to hospital, the patient was isolated due to the COVID-19 infection. Blood pressure was 102/72 mm Hg, heart rate was 100 beats/min, respiratory rate was 17/min and rectal temperature was 37.2°C. Clinical examination revealed normal organ findings including pulmonary and cardiac examination. The ECG showed sinus tachycardia, insignificant ST-elevation in inferior leads and T-wave inversion in precordial leads (). Furthermore, there was low-voltage ECG with peak-to-peak QRS amplitude less than 5 mm in the standard leads and 10 mm in the precordial leads (V5 and V6). All ECG findings were stationary during the course. Laboratory findings showed glucose 7.2 mmol/L, normal electrolytes, mild elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP) 11 and significantly elevated leucocyte count 13.2×109/L, troponin T 108 ng/L, NT-proBNP 1025 ng/L. Comprehensive description of laboratory tests and therapy is shown in . Bedside cardiac ultrasound examination performed by the on-call cardiac resident using a hand-held ultrasound device revealed moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, reduced left ventricular EF, dilated inferior caval vein with reduced respiratory variation and pericardial effusion at a maximum of 18 mm, a small right ventricle and a slight impression of the right atrium (). She was subsequently transferred to the ICU and treated with fluid support and norepinephrine. Day to day fluid and pressor treatment are highlighted in . The results of the point-of-care ultrasound examination were confirmed by echocardiography at the ICU. The left ventricle presented with a moderate concentric hypertrophy with a small cavity with end-diastolic volume less than 70 mL. Furthermore, there was a striking hyperechogenic pattern of the endocardium and epicardium ( and ). She deteriorated the following day with decreasing blood pressure and diuresis, with only a modest response on supportive treatment with fluid and pressor (norepinephrine (NA) and dobutamine). Fluid support was provided due to extensive peripheral capillary leakage. The extremities were cold and wet, but cognition was normal and beside international normalization ratio (INR) 1.2–1.3 there was no other sign of organ failure. Pericardiocentesis was performed at day 9 due to subacute deterioration and echocardiographic signs of a tamponade including compression of the right atrium, dilated inferior vena cava without inspiratory diameter reduction and respiratory variation in volumes and flow velocities ( and ). After initial drainage of 300 mL of serosal pericardial fluid, there was an immediate reduction of the respiratory variation of inflow patterns. The systolic blood pressure increased from 60 mm Hg to 95 mm Hg followed by increased diuresis. Size and function of the cardiac chambers together with mitral inflow pattern and filling of the left ventricle normalised gradually over the following days (, ). The left ventricular myocardial thickness and striking echogenicity were reduced in the same period. Cardiac output and blood pressure improved correspondingly. The patient needed supportive fluid therapy due to capillary leakage until day 15 when she was transferred to the ward.\nThe pericardial fluid tested negative in PCR for COVID-19. Cardiac (CMRI) study performed at day 15 was consistent with the diagnosis of acute perimyocarditis. T1-mapping showed relaxation times of 1260–1270 ms in the anterolateral wall compared with 1090 ms in the septum. The corresponding T2-mapping relaxation times were 60–61 ms and 52–53 ms, respectively.

    "question": "A 72-year-old man with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and prostate cancer accompanied by multiple bone metastasis had sudden chest and back pain and difficulty in breathing at rest. His chest pain was accompanied by heaviness, squeezing, and discomfort. His prostate cancer had been treated with bicalutamide (80 mg/day) for ∼2 years, and his cancer stage was stable. He was brought to our hospital by ambulance and his vital signs were as follows: heart rate 72/min, respiratory rate 24/min, an axillary temperature 36.2°C, saturation of percutaneous oxygen under room air 90%, and peak blood pressure of 190/108 mmHg. There was no pleural effusion or congestion in the chest radiograph (). Electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with a complete right bundle branch block (CRBBB) and no significant ST-segment changes (). His initial serum troponin I level was 0.05 ng/mL (normal value: <0.04 ng/mL) and the d-dimer level was 14.7 μg/mL (normal value: <1.0 μg/mL). White blood cell count was 12 900/μL (normal value: 4000–7500/μL) and brain natriuretic peptide was 110 pg/mL (normal value: <18.4 pg/mL); other laboratory values were within normal range. The echocardiogram did not show any wall motion abnormality, significant valve disease, right ventricle dilation, or obvious congenital heart disease such as a patent foramen ovale. His chest CT with contrast showed bilateral scattered PE and left deep vein thrombus (from popliteal vein to soleus vein) (). After admission, his chest pain persisted, and the serum troponin I level and ECG were checked repeatedly. Although his serial ECG did not show no significant changes (), his serum troponin I level 3 h after the admission was elevated to 0.90 ng/mL. Furthermore, reconstruction of the SDCT (IQon Spectral CT; Philips healthcare) images clearly showed a perfusion defect of the posterolateral left ventricle myocardium (), suggesting a combination of PE and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).\nFollowing these findings, coronary angiogram was then performed which showed total occlusion of the OM branch. Although atherosclerotic plaques were seen in multiple coronary arteries, significant stenosis was not observed except for the OM branch (). Consequently, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed to the occlusion site. After thrombectomy, intracoronary imaging using intravascular ultrasound was performed, and atherosclerotic plaque lesions were observed (). Two drug-eluting stents were deployed (Synergy 2.75/28 mm and Synergy 2.25/20 mm), and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 3 flow was achieved (). The creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB peaked at 2034 and 278 IU/L (normal values: CK 60–287 IU/L and CK-MB <25 IU/L) 8 h after the admission.\nFollowing treatment of ACS, we began treatment for PE with an oral anticoagulant (OAC, rivaroxaban 30 mg/day). He was relieved of his chest symptoms and was rescued from a hypoxic state. He was discharged on the 14th day after admission. Enhanced SDCT and associated reconstructed images of effective atomic number (Z-effective) 6 months after the treatment started, until when dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 100 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg/day) and OAC therapy (rivaroxaban 30 mg/day for 3 weeks and 15 mg/day after 3 weeks) were continued, showed improvement in perfusion defects in both pulmonary fields () and the myocardium (). His treatment was deescalated to single antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel 75 mg/day) and OAC, and he has had a good course without recurrence.

He was recently started on pazopanib for systemic treatment of metastatic RCC. Pazopanib was started at 75% of the recommended dose. At the initiation of therapy, the patient had a creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL and was able to walk 90 min a day without any complaints.\nWithin the first week of starting pazopanib, the patient developed dyspnoea on exertion that progressed rapidly to dyspnoea on minimal exertion. He was no longer able to conduct his daily walks. On the 10th day after starting pazopanib, he was unable to shave himself due to dyspnoea, which prompted his ED presentation. In the ED, his blood pressure (BP) was 122/70 mm Hg, heart rate (HR) was 93 beats per minute (bpm), respiratory rate (RR) was 22 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. On physical examination, auscultation of the heart was significant for an irregular rhythm with no additional heart sounds or signs of volume overload. His lungs were clear to auscultation, and the remainder of the examination was unremarkable.\nInitial labs were significant for a creatinine of 1.4 mg/mL and a supratherapeutic international normalised ratio of 4.0. Blood counts, electrolytes and liver function tests were within normal limits. His B-natriuretic peptide (BNP) was 2685 pg/mL. His troponin results were negative. An ECG showed atrial fibrillation without significant changes compared with previous tracings. A CT angiogram (CTA) of the chest in the ED showed heterogeneous opacification of the left main pulmonary artery with concern for a non-occlusive thrombus.\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital and empirically started on anticoagulation with enoxaparin for presumed pulmonary embolism (PE). On the second day, he presented with worsening shortness of breath and compromised mental status. On physical examination, he was dyspnoeic and tachypnoeic with RR of 40 breaths/min and oxygen saturation of 95% on 2 L of oxygen by nasal cannula. His HR ranged between 140 and 150 bpm and his BP was 96/53 mm Hg. He was in respiratory distress, unable to speak in full sentences but alert and following commands.

It was followed by bilateral pedal edema in a day and in next three days followed by sudden onset bilateral foot drop with numbness. Patient gave history of nausea, vomiting, skin rash, anorexia and malaise since 20 days. He had weight loss of 10 kg in last 20 days. The past medical history was unremarkable. Alcohol consumption and drug abuse were absent. On physical examination, temperature was 38.4°C, blood pressure was 160/100 mm Hg, pulse rate 84/min and respiratory rate 20/min. Pedal edema was pitting, bilateral. Macular skin rashes around both ankles were present. Testicular tenderness was present. There was sensory and motor involvement in bilateral tibia and peroneal nerve distribution. Funduscopic examination showed grade 3 hypertensive retinopathy. Laboratory examination revealed a hemoglobin of 12.1 g/dl, white blood cell count of 24000/µl, platelet count of 485000/µl. Serum creatinine was 2.4 mg/dl, blood urea nitrogen 102 mg/dl, potassium 5.0 mEq/l, albumin 3.1 g/dl, aspartate aminotransferase 27 U/l, alanine aminotransferase 20 U/l, alkaline phosphatase 131 U/l and total cholesterol 198 mg/dl.

    "question": "A 6-year-old girl (height 110 cm, weight 20.3 kg) with no medical history had a fever 1 month before surgery. She visited a clinic and general hospital due to jaundice and malaise. At admission to the general hospital 2 weeks before surgery, she was diagnosed with acute hepatitis and was given liver protection drugs (Stronger Neo-Minophagen C, Lactulose, Vitamin K) and fresh frozen plasma, although her liver and coagulation function deteriorated during the course of treatment, along with decrease in platelet count. She was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of our children's medical center for blood purification therapy 4 days before surgery.\nOn examination, she looked ill. Physical examination revealed the following: blood pressure 95/56 mm Hg, pulse rate 72 beats/min, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min with SpO2 of 99% on room air, body temperature 37.3 °C, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of E3V4M6. Abdominal examination was unremarkable, with no hepatosplenomegaly. Examination of the eyes and skin revealed icterus.\nInitial laboratory investigations revealed thrombocytopenia (hemoglobin 13.0 g/dL, white cell count 3.4 × 103/μL, platelet count 9.1 × 104/μL). Electrolytes were normal (Na 139 mmol/L, K 4.2 mmol/L, Cl 103 mmol/L, Ca 9.5 mg/dL, Mg 2.3 mg/dL, P 3.9 mg/dL). Her coagulation profile was prolonged (prothrombin time 23%, prothrombin time-international normalized ratio 2.36, activated partial thromboplastin time 63.7 s) and liver function tests were abnormal (albumin 4.0 g/dL, total bilirubin 18.76 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 13.17 mg/dL, venous ammonia 70 μg/dL, lactate 2.2 mmol/L). Infectious disease screening tests were negative. Computed tomography (CT) scan of her abdomen showed lower absorption in the liver compared to the spleen, suggesting ALF. Cranial CT scan and fundus examination were normal. Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed slow spindle waves with a frequency of 1–2 Hz, without laterality or triphasic waves (Fig. a). Daily plasma exchange and continuous hemodiafiltration were started for ALF with HE. Mannitol was administered to prevent cerebral edema. A day before surgery, GCS scores worsened to E1VTM1. Clinically, she was unresponsive to pain and auditory stimuli, and her EEG showed high voltage continuous slow waves with a frequency of 0.5–1 Hz, without lateralization (Fig. b). Assuming deterioration of HE, emergency LT was considered vital. After obtaining informed consent from her family, urgent living donor LT with an extended left liver graft from her mother was planned on the 5th ICU day.\nGeneral anesthesia was induced with fentanyl (50 mcg) and rocuronium (20 mg) and maintained with remifentanil and rocuronium infusions (0.1–0.4 mcg/kg/min and 7 mcg/kg/min, respectively), along with sevoflurane inhalation at 0.5%. A BIS Quatro Brain Monitoring Sensor (Medtronic plc, Dublin, Ireland) was placed on the frontotemporal region, and her electroencephalogram, including BIS values, 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF95), and suppression ratio (SR), was continuously recorded at each phase of liver transplantation by the BIS monitor until the end of anesthesia (Fig. , Fig. a–d). The durations of anesthesia and surgery were 708 min and 637 min, respectively. The graft volume was 254 g, graft volume/recipient standard liver volume (GV/SLV) was 46.1%, and graft-to-recipient weight ratio (GRWR) was 1.27%. Warm and cold ischemia times were 40 min and 51 min, respectively. BIS values ranged from 10 to 20 from the start of the operation to reperfusion (Fig. ). From reperfusion to the end of the operation, BIS values ranged from 10 to 80, and the variation in BIS values also increased. The frequency of EEG waveforms and BIS values seen with BIS monitoring gradually increased (Fig. ). She was re-admitted to the PICU after surgery, extubated on postoperative day (POD) 2 and discharged from the PICU on POD 7. Follow-up EEG on POD 5 showed low amplitude and fast waves with a frequency of 9–10 Hz, without laterality or paroxysmal waves (Fig. c). However, she spoke only a few words until POD 7. Two weeks postoperatively, she was newly diagnosed with hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia. Her immunosuppressant regimen was changed and continued for post liver transplantation prophylaxis and aplastic anemia. She was discharged after 4 months of hospitalization. The cause of liver failure in the present case remains unknown. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

Medical history included right nephrectomy for a renal stone 21 years earlier and medication for arterial hypertension 4 years earlier. The pain was localized to the lower abdomen without aggravating factors. Upon admission to the department of gynecology, the patient looked ill and had a temperature of 37.4℃, a blood pressure of 134/59 mmHg, a pulse of 77 beats/min, and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min. The abdomen was slightly distended and tender over the lower abdomen, without signs of generalized peritoneal irritation. Pelvic examination showed an atrophied vagina and cervix, and a yellowish foul odorous vaginal discharge from the cervical os. Laboratory test results were within normal limits, except for a white blood cell count of 27,580/µL and a neutrophil fraction of 88.3%. Culture of the vaginal discharge revealed Escherichia coli and Enterococcus avium. Endovaginal sonography showed fluid collection measuring 2.7 × 2.4 cm in the endometrium, suggesting a pyometrium. Abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) showed a myometrial abscess cavity in the uterus and diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon. Tomography also showed that the uterine had joined to the thick sigmoid wall (). However, no definite fistula tract was visible. A colouterine fistula caused by diverticulitis was suspected. Therefore, fistulography was performed. When contrast fluid was injected through the cervical os, spillage of the contrast fluid into the sigmoid colon via the left side of the abscess cavity of the uterine fundus was observed (). On colonoscopy, multiple diverticula were noted at the sigmoid colon, and a suspected lesion of the fistula opening with surrounding edema and emission of air bubbles was detected approximately 25 cm from the anal verge (). The patient was diagnosed with a colouterine fistula caused by diverticulitis and was transferred to the department of surgery for a collaborative operation.\nDuring the operation, inflammatory adhesion of the distal sigmoid colon to the posterior wall of the uterus was found (). The colon was dissected off the uterus, and a fistula between the sigmoid colon and the endometrial cavity was identified. Primary resection of the sigmoid colon, including the affected segment, with anastomosis and repair of the fistula tract of the uterus were performed.

    "question": "A 53-year-old Korean man who had undergone curative surgical resection for stage iii (T3N2M0) colon cancer was evaluated in clinic by his medical oncologist before the start of adjuvant chemotherapy. He appeared clinically well on assessment and proceeded to receive his first cycle of modified folfox-6 chemotherapy. This regimen consisted of oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, folinic acid 400 mg/m2, and 5-fluorouracil (5-fu) 400 mg/m2 bolus on day 1, followed by 5-fu 2400 mg/m2 by continuous infusion over the next 46 hours. Dexamethasone 12 mg and ondansetron 8 mg were given as pre-medication before chemotherapy.\nThe patient experienced no acute side effects or complications in the chemotherapy unit. He was discharged home with an ambulatory 5-fu pump and was scheduled to return to the clinic at completion of his 5-fu infusion.\nTwenty-four hours later, the patient presented to the emergency department with new symptoms of erratic behaviour and confusion. Collateral history from the accompanying family members revealed that he had suffered a brief generalized tonic–clonic seizure earlier in the day, but no apparent history of head injuries, infectious symptoms, or recent alcohol intake was present. The patient’s other medical problems included well-controlled hypertension, hyperlipidemia, polycystic kidney disease, chronic renal insufficiency (baseline creatinine: 172 mmol/L), and stable chronic hepatitis B carrier status without laboratory or radiologic evidence of cirrhosis. No history of epilepsy was present. The patient’s only oral medications were amlodipine, quinapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and atorvastatin. He was an ex-smoker, and he denied alcohol abuse and illicit drugs.\nOn examination in the emergency department, the patient was neither alert nor oriented. He was unable to follow commands, and his verbal responses were incomprehensible. He was agitated, and his limbs were tremulous at rest. Temperature was 35.9°C; heart rate, 82/min; respirations, 18/min; blood pressure, 130/84 mmHg; and O2 saturation on room air, 99%. The patient’s eyes appeared deviated to his left side, but pupils were equal and reactive. Spontaneous twitching of the extremities, on the left side more than on the right, was noted and attributed to possible complex partial seizures. No other focal neurologic deficits or evidence of trauma were present. The Brudzinski and Kernig signs were negative. Examinations of chest, heart, and abdomen were otherwise unremarkable. The patient was noted to be incontinent of urine during the assessment. He was treated with intravenous diazepam and phenytoin (given in a loading dose of 1000 mg) for his agitation and presumed seizure activity respectively. At this point, his 5-fu infusion pump was still attached and functioning.\nLaboratory investigations showed leucocytosis (white blood cell count: 19.5 × 109/L) with left shift, but an otherwise normal complete blood cell count. Liver enzyme tests were within normal limits. Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were elevated (239 mmol/L and 8.6 mmol/L respectively). Metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 29 mmol/L was present. Imaging of the head and brain by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scan respectively did not demonstrate evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, mass, or other abnormalities. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was benign, and subsequent cultures of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and urine were all negative. Of note, serum ammonia, at 316 mmol/L, and serum lactate, at 8.3 mmol/L, were elevated. The remainder of the toxicology screen was completely unremarkable. Vitamin B12 level and thyroid function tests were normal. An electroencephalogram showed a generalized slowing pattern consistent with metabolic encephalopathy.\nOver the next 8 hours, the patient’s mental status progressively deteriorated to a comatose state. The 5-fu infusion pump was discontinued. Because the patient was no longer adequately protecting his airway, the critical care team was consulted for patient intubation and admission to the intensive care unit. With an apparent cause for the rapidly progressive cognitive dysfunction still lacking, lactulose at a dose of 30 mL every 4 hours was administered by nasogastric tube shortly thereafter in an effort to correct the patient’s encephalopathy. Phenytoin was continued.\nFollowing the cessation of 5-fu and administration of lactulose, the patient gradually recovered over the next 48 hours from his acute confusional state. He experienced significant fatigue and muscle weakness, but no further seizures. Successive ammonia levels showed a decreasing trend. The patient was extubated, and phenytoin was discontinued. This man was discharged home on day 8 with instructions to follow up with his medical oncologist the following week.\nAfter discharge, the patient required several weeks to recuperate before he could embark on additional chemotherapy. Considering his presumed neuropsychiatric complication from folfox chemotherapy, raltitrexed (3 mg/m2) and oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2) were given every 3 weeks as adjuvant treatment instead. This therapy was provided on an inpatient basis because of the insistence of the patient. No significant adverse reactions were noted. Unfortunately, re-staging investigations shortly thereafter revealed three metastatic lesions in the liver. We plan to continue with further chemotherapy for this patient with the goal of potential resection of his liver lesions in the future. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

She was promptly placed on nasal cannula and subsequently on nonrebreather 100% FiO2, with an improvement of her oxygen saturation to 95%.\nHer initial laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 10.9 K/µL (normal range [NR] 3.8-10.8 K/µL), absolute lymphocyte count of 0.64 K/µL (NR 0.85-3.9 K/µL), hemoglobin 14.1 g/dL (NR 13.2-17.1 g/dL), platelets 214 K/µL (NR 140-400 K/µL), C-reactive protein 30.94 mg/dL (NR < 0.80 mg/dL), ferritin 998 µg/L, lactic acid 3.3 mmol/L (NR 0.5-2.2 mmol/L), lactate dehydrogenase 556 U/L (NR 125-220 U/L), troponin was negative (NR < 0.30 ng/mL), creatinine 1.0 mg/dL (NR 0.7-1.3 mg/dL), Na 138 mmol/L (NR 135-145 mmol/L), K 3.4 mmol/L (NR 3.5-5.1 mmol/L), and high-sensitivity D-dimer 806 ng/mL (NR < 231 ng/mL).\nThe chest radiograph obtained in the emergency department demonstrated multiple rounded and peripheral ground-glass opacities throughout the lung fields (Figure ).\nA nasopharyngeal swab was performed and tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. Due to severe hypoxia, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). On hospital day 2, she underwent intubation and mechanical ventilation for worsening tachypnea and respiratory distress. The patient was started on intravenous steroids (methylprednisolone 40 mg every eight hours), received a dose of tocilizumab 400 mg, and completed a five-day course of hydroxychloroquine (800 mg/day for one day, then 400 mg/day for four days) and azithromycin (500 mg/day for one day, then 250 mg/day for four days).\nOn hospital day 3, her renal function worsened, and her creatinine peaked at 2.4 mg/dL, likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis. However, she remained with good urine output and no significant metabolic acidosis. Her creatinine gradually improved on the subsequent days, returning to the baseline renal function. The patient remained stable hemodynamically and sedated with hydromorphone and ketamine, but despite the optimized medical management she continued to spike fevers at 102°F, and repeated chest imaging with CT on day 5 showed significant worsening bilateral ground-glass airspace opacities (Figure ).\nOn hospital day 7, she received convalescent plasma transfusion and started on vancomycin after respiratory cultures demonstrated the presence of Staphylococcus aureus infection. On hospital day 8, the patient had an episode of oxygen desaturation to 75% with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 79, despite being on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 100% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 12 cm H2O. She was bagged by the respiratory therapist for over one hour and given the failure of mechanical ventilation to provide adequate oxygenation, the decision was to start VV-ECMO.\nThe patient’s left femoral vein was cannulated with a 28-Fr heparin-coated cannula for blood return and the left internal jugular vein was cannulated with a 21-Fr cannula for blood access. The patient was placed on VV-ECMO (CentriMag [Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA, USA] short-term external circulatory device) with initial settings of flow 4.5 liters per minute, speed 3,300 revolutions per minute, and ECMO FiO2 100%, sweep three liters per minute. She was started on heparin drip, received infusion of neuromuscular blocking agent cisatracurium for a short period, and then remained sedated with hydromorphone and lorazepam. She continued to have episodes of fevers up to 101°F, and repeated sputum cultures demonstrated the presence of Acinetobacter species and Proteus mirabilis, while blood cultures were negative. She was placed on cefepime for ventilator-associated pneumonia and the episodes of fevers gradually improved.\nOn the following two weeks, the patient was gradually able to wean down VV-ECMO settings, decreasing ECMO FiO2 to 40%, and flow to 3.6 liters per minute. On hospital day 20, she had a transvenous pacemaker placed due to several episodes of bradycardia with pauses lasting up to 19 seconds during oral care, likely vagally mediated. On hospital day 21, a bronchoscopy was performed and showed minimal secretions and no mucus plug. Given her prolonged time intubated, she underwent tracheostomy placement on hospital day 22. On hospital day 26, the patient was finally able to have VV-ECMO explanted, after 18 days of extracorporeal therapy. As she continued to improve clinically, the mechanical ventilation was successfully weaned off on hospital day 38. The patient was noted to have no neurological deficits, and was able to be downgraded from ICU to the medical ward on the following day. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

Three weeks prior to her presentation, she tested positive for COVID-19 infection after developing symptoms of shortness of breath and chest pain. She was quarantined at her home and treated symptomatically with improvement. She never required hospitalization for her symptoms nor medications. She denied smoking and alcohol or illicit drug use along with any other medication that could cause QT interval prolongation. Upon her presentation, her physical examination was noted to be significant for bradycardia. Her vitals were blood pressure of 118/63 mmHg, a heart rate of 45 bpm, a temperature of 98.3 °F, and a respiratory rate of 18 sating 100% on room air. Her electrocardiogram showed 45 bpm with narrow QRS complex and premature atrial complexes.\nSignificant laboratory results included a WBC of 18.24 k/μL (3.60–9.50), troponin negative at <0.03 ng/mL (≤0.04), normal TSH at 3.79 uIU/mL (0.34–5.60), CRP at 27.00 mg/L (≤10.00), ESR at 51 mm/h (0–20), procalcitonin at <0.02 ng/mL (0.00–0.10), a COVID-19 PCR positive, BNP at 160 pg/mL (≤100), lactate at 1.2 mmol/L (0.5–2.2), and a negative urine drug screen. The chest X-ray showed no acute events. The transthoracic echocardiogram was normal with an EF of 60%. The patient was walked on treadmill and her junctional heart rhythm increased to 91 bpm; she was given 1 mg of atropine IV over a period of 5 min, in which her sinus rate increased to >100 bpm. Given the improvement in the patient’s symptoms, there was no indication for a dual chamber pacemaker. Hence, she was started on theophylline 200 mg oral dose daily with follow up within 1 week at the clinic (A,B). Upon her follow up, she had a heart rate of 90 bpm while on theophylline and no side effects were reported. Later, at her 5-week follow up visit, a complete resolution of her symptoms was reported and theophylline use was discontinued. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

The patient was a current smoker with a 20-pack-year smoking history and chronic alcoholics, with a 0.5 bottle per day, over 40 yrs. He had no prior liver insult.\nPhysical examination revealed no specific finding. He did not have palpable lymph nodes on the head, neck, and inguinal area. There was no suspicious skin lesion. Digital rectal examination was negative, and no perirectal mass or lesion was found. Breathing sound was clear without wheezing or crackle.\nInitial vital sign was non-specific (blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, pulse rate 70/min, respiratory rate 20/min, body temperature 36.3°C). Laboratory work-up showed an elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP)/Gamma-guanosine triphosphate (r-GTP) level of 345/245 IU/L. But total bilirubin 0.44 mg/dL, serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (AST) 22 IU/L and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (ALT) 27 IU/L level were within normal limits. Complete blood count showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia (WBC 14,800/mm3, segmented neutrophil 79.5%), anemia (Hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL) and thrombocytosis (Platelet 485 ×103/mm3). Hepatitis viral markers were all negative, and Ca 19-9 level was slightly elevated (28.58 U/mL). Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) 1.38ng/mL, protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II (PIVKA-II) 55 mAU/mL, carcino-embryonic Antigen (CEA) level were 4.45 ng/mL, all of them were within normal limits.\nA computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed a 10 × 6 cm sized low attenuated mass involving segment VIII and left lobe of the liver, invading left portal vein and bile duct. Unlike primary hepatocellular carcinoma, liver mass showed delayed fill-in enhancement pattern, which mimics cholangiocarcinoma, rather than primary hepatocellular carcinoma (). But Tumor thrombi was invading the middle hepatic vein, extending to the right atrium via inferior vena cava, which was unusual finding for mass-forming cholangiocarcinoma ().\nAlso, there were multiple metastatic lymphadenopathy involving porta hepatis, portocaval, retrocaval and paraaortic space, with benign-looking multiple cysts in the both kidneys, 2.2 cm cyst in the uncinate process of pancreas.\nNon-enhanced Chest CT from other hospital showed metastasis to the right ninth rib and surrounding paravertebral soft tissue with osteolytic change (). As mass size was huge and showed the aggressive form, we decided to perform positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) for evaluating disease extent.\nAdditionally, PET-CT scan revealed a small hypermetabolic lymph node in the left supraclavicular area, which was suspected as metastatic lesion (). Excisional biopsy on supraclavicular lymph node returned negative. In turn, we had to perform an ultrasonography guided needle biopsy of the liver for pathologic confirmation. Pathology of the liver mass showed infiltrating feature with squamoid shaped cells with varying degrees of differentiation and atypia, which suggests tumor mass as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma (). Immunohistochimistry and special staining for needle biopsy specimens were positive for cytokeratin (CK) 7, 8, 19, and p63. And anti-hepatocyte was negative, suggesting tumor as primary or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the liver ().\nThe patient underwent an extensive workup to search for a primary squamous carcinoma lesion, including neck CT, chest CT, duodenoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, laryngoscopy and ENT survey, all of which turned out to be negative. Taken together, we concluded the tumor as a primary SCC of the liver.\nDuring the hospital day, patient presented uncontrolled high and recurrent fever, which was suspected to be the cancer fever. Patient’s general condition continued to get worsen. First, we considered palliative chemotherapy, however we failed to conduct due to his poor general condition (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 3). The patient started palliative radiotherapy for right paravertebral mass. After 10 times of radiation therapy, patient refused further treatment and transferred to the local hospital for hospice care, and passed away about a month after discharge.

She had no spontaneous movement, no response to painful stimuli, no pupillary reflex, and no corneal reflex. Doll's eye movement was absent. Her pupils were 1 mm in diameter and nonreactive to light. Deep tendon reflexes were absent.\nApproximately 1 hour after arrival she had a second generalized tonic clonic seizure with fever that lasted 10 seconds, and was treated with 0.3 mg/kg of intravenous diazepam. She had dark brown-colored hematemesis, so we performed L-tube irrigation with normal saline. A computed tomography (CT) scan indicated diffuse symmetric low density in the basal ganglia, thalami, and pons with brain swelling (). Because of brain swelling, unstable vital sign, and thrombocytopenia, we decided to defer lumbar puncture and after all we did not make it. She was admitted to the intensive care unit.\nHer platelet count was 32,000/µL, white blood cell was 6,240/µL, aspartate aminotransferase was 4,579 U/L, alanine aminotransferase was 2,787 U/L, ammonia was 38 mmol/L and C-reactive protein was 1.0 mg/dL. Coagulation testing for prothrombin, partial thromboplastin and thrombin times, fibrin degradation products, and D-dimer were elevated. Blood urea nitrogen was 30 mg/dL and serum creatinine was 1.3 mg/dL. Creatine kinase-MB, myoglobin, and troponin-T were elevated. Respiratory virus polymerase chain reactions for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, and rhinovirus were negative, but the test for parainfluenza virus was positive on a nasal wash specimen. Serological tests for hepatitis viruses, mycoplasma, herpes virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and salmonella were all negative.\nElectroencephalography indicated extremely low voltage and featureless background rhythms (). Brain MRI performed on the day of hospitalization indicated diffuse bilateral symmetric signal changes of both basal ganglia, thalami, periventricular white matter, pons, and cerebral white matter, as well as generalized swelling of the brain. The involved areas were diffusely hypointense on T1W images () and hyperintense on T2W images (). We diagnosed the patient with ANE based on the clinical symptoms and MRI findings.\nThe patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated because of shallow breathing and profound alteration of sensorium on the day of hospitalization and she was treated with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, acyclovir, intravenous immunoglobulin, and methylprednisolone. A chest X-ray was normal at admission, but indicated right perihilar infiltration on the 5th day of admission. Her consciousness had no interval change, and blood pressure, heart rate, and urine output decreased on day 13. The 14th day of admission, she died due to multiple organ failure.

    "question": "A 65-year-old African American female with past medical history significant for noninsulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus, essential hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic back pain, morbid obesity (body mass index (BMI) was 41), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), uterine fibroids, generalized anxiety disorder, and former tobacco abuse presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of generalized abdominal pain of 3 weeks' duration with intermittent diarrhea and constipation. Upon review of systems, she complained of atypical chest pain which was pleuritic and reproducible on palpation. The chest pain was nonexertional but she had exertional dyspnea. Of note, she had no prior history of cardiovascular disease.\nPast surgical history was remarkable for cesarean section and hysterectomy. Prior to admission medications included metformin, hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol, ranitidine, and acetaminophen. Family history was remarkable for diabetes. In terms of social history, she was a former tobacco smoker, drank alcohol socially, and denied illicit drug use. She had a history of allergy to hydroxyzine, propoxyphene, and zomepirac.\nIn the ED, measurement of vital signs showed a temperature of 37.0°C, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 148/82, and pulse oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Initial physical examination was normal except for obesity, depressed mood, chest wall tenderness, mild abdominal distention with tympanic note to percussion and mild generalized nonspecific tenderness to palpation. Rectal exam showed small nonbleeding external hemorrhoids. Complete blood count and basic metabolic panel were normal except for blood glucose of 240 milligrams/deciliter (mg/dL). Hemoglobin A1c was 9.3%. Troponin I was slightly elevated at 0.07 and it trended down on second measurement. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with new T-wave inversion in the inferolateral leads. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was only remarkable for fecal stasis in the rectum. Her abdominal pain and constipation was partially relieved after administration of IV morphine and senna-docusate.\nShe was also given aspirin for the chest pain. After her abdominal symptoms moderately improved, she was placed in the observation unit for cardiology consultation. After evaluation by the cardiologist, she was admitted to a telemetry unit for an inpatient cardiac stress test. She was receiving 81 mg aspirin daily. On day 2 of hospital admission, she underwent myocardial perfusion scan using the standard 0.4 mg regadenoson (LEXISCAN) injection. The stress test showed reversible perfusion defect involving the apex and lateral wall of the left ventricle, suggesting myocardial ischemia. At that time, clopidogrel (Plavix) was added to aspirin and the patient was started on IV heparin per ACS protocol pending cardiac catheterization. On day 4, coronary angiography was performed and it showed no significant occlusive coronary artery disease (CAD). During the catheterization procedure, the patient received IV heparin and IV nitroglycerin in addition to midazolam for sedation and fentanyl for analgesia. The radio contrast used was iohexol (OMNIPAQUE 350). Post-procedure, IV heparin was discontinued while DAPT with aspirin and Plavix were resumed.\nAfter recovery from sedation, the patient complained of a headache which got progressively worse within a few hours. It did not improve with repeated doses of oral hydrocodone and oral/IV acetaminophen. After around 12 hours of cardiac catheterization, the patient developed acute left-sided ptosis, deviated gaze (down and outward palsy), and anisocoria with left pupillary dilation (mydriasis) consistent with acute left 3rd nerve palsy (). The patient did not complain of decreased vision and visual field testing by confrontation was normal. She had no other sensory or motor deficits. Her mental status examination did not show evidence of confusion. Her vital signs were normal. STAT CT head without contrast (per stroke protocol) was read as negative for acute intracranial process. CTA of the head and neck was negative for arterial stenosis or aneurysms. The next day, MRI head and orbit with and without contrast were done using Gadodiamide as the MRI contrast agent. The MRI report, as read in our hospital, indicated a nonenhancing heterogeneous pituitary mass measuring 1.9 × 2.0 cm in the greatest dimension and slightly compressing on the optic chiasm suggestive of pituitary macroadenoma (). There was no report of any bleed/infarction by either CT or MRI report.\nA multidisciplinary team approach was undertaken with involvement of neurology, endocrinology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology (ENT), and neurosurgery. A full ophthalmological examination was normal except for complete left 3rd nerve palsy and mild cataracts. Visual field testing was normal. Hormonal studies were ordered and the results were as shown in . Of note, prolactin was lower than normal, while adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level was above the reference range. Both follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) were considered low given the patient's postmenopausal status. The patient had normal random cortisol and free T4 level. She did not receive any IV glucocorticoids. The next day after the third nerve palsy, the patient developed a mild fever at 37.9°C with mild neutrophilic leukocytosis (white blood cell count 14.2 K/UL). The patient was transferred to a neuro step-down unit for close observation. Her vital signs remained mostly normal. Subjectively, she neither had a progression of symptoms nor developed new symptoms. Her headache was controlled with oral hydrocodone/acetaminophen. Her full neurologic examination remained normal except for isolated complete left oculomotor palsy. Leukocytosis gradually normalized over several days.\nPituitary apoplexy was highly suspected as a cause of the third nerve palsy, but the diagnosis was challenged by the fact that our radiologist's interpretation of imaging did not mention bleed or cavernous sinus extension. The diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy of the third nerve from microvascular ischemia was contemplated but it was felt less likely because it is usually pupil-sparing []. Neurosurgery requested ENT help for trans-sphenoidal pituitary resection. ENT did not feel comfortable with the plan and recommended transfer to a higher level center. The patient and her family were involved in decision making. They were truthfully told that our medical center is not a high volume center for such pituitary cases and the patient might benefit from a transfer to a more experienced center. They chose to transfer and the patient was transferred by ambulance to an academic center of excellence on day 7 of presentation.\nThere, neuroradiologists read the images obtained at our hospital differently. The new CT scan report indicated increased attenuation of the sella turcica and in the suprasellar cistern at the site of the patient's pituitary mass, suggestive of possible hemorrhage within the tumor (). The new MRI report indicated that there was a sellar/suprasellar mass lesion which appeared to show central intrinsic T1 shortening and hypoenhancement with peripheral right-sided enhancement. There was mass effect on the optic chiasm superiorly. The lesion appeared to extend laterally into the left cavernous sinus with mild mass effect on the cavernous internal carotid artery. The overall hypoenhancing portion measured 2.1 × 1.9 × 1.3 cm (Figures and ).\nThe physicians in the other hospital decided to proceed with surgical intervention hoping to relieve the pressure on the third nerve. On day 9 of symptoms, the patient underwent successful trans-sphenoidal pituitary resection. Intraoperatively, the neurosurgeon reported a typical contused apoplectic adenoma. A frozen section biopsy report, as well as final pathology report, confirmed necrotic pituitary tumor with evidence of recent hemorrhage. The apoplectic adenoma was removed and the pituitary gland was left intact. Postoperatively, the laboratory assessment indicated central hypothyroidism and secondary adrenal insufficiency. Vital signs were stable. No major sodium abnormalities were noted. The patient was started on oral hydrocortisone and levothyroxine. Otherwise, the immediate postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged home on day 11 of symptoms development. One-month follow-up at the neurosurgeon's office was remarkable for persistence of oculomotor palsy. A six-month follow-up is scheduled. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 46-year-old Japanese man without a remarkable medical history visited our hospital with chief complaints of fever, fatigue, generalized edema, and abdominal distention. His fever started two weeks prior to admission. Abdominal distention and edema gradually worsened, and he gained 7 kg of weight within two weeks, despite low food intake owing to loss of appetite. He denied previous episodes of infectious diseases. At initial presentation, he appeared exhausted. His vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 37.8 °C; blood pressure, 160/93 mmHg; heart rate, 109 beats/min; respiratory rate, 22 breathes/min; and oxygen saturation, 90% with room air. On physical examination, generalized pitting edema was observed. His heart sounds were normal, but his lung sounds were weak at the lung base on both sides. Jaundice was not observed, but a distended abdomen and hepatomegaly were observed. Blood test results on the day of admission revealed an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count (14,600/μL), mild anemia (hemoglobin level, 11.1 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 11.1 × 104/μL), renal impairment (blood urea nitrogen level, 60.7 mg/dL and serum creatinine level, 2.94 mg/dL), an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level (14.25 mg/dL), an elevated ALP level (768 U/L), polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia (immunoglobulin G [IgG], 2461 mg/dL), and an elevated IgG4 level (235 mg/dL). Immunological screening test results for autoantibodies were negative, except for positive antinuclear antibody (× 40) and anti-SS-A antibody. Polymerase chain reaction for HHV-8 DNA in a serum sample was negative (Table ). Computed tomography (CT) performed on the day of admission revealed massive pleural effusions and ascites, generalized mild lymphadenopathy (< 1.5 cm in diameter), and hepatosplenomegaly (Fig. ). Echocardiography performed on day 2 revealed normal wall motions without any sign of valvular disease, but a collapsed inferior vena cava was observed (maximum diameter < 5 mm). 18F–fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) revealed no apparent FDG uptake, except for slight uptake in the para-aortic lymph nodes (Fig. ). Considering the positive anti-SS-A antibody finding, lip biopsy was performed on day 6, but the pathological findings did not meet the criteria for Sjögren syndrome (SjS). On ophthalmological examination, keratoconjunctivitis was not observed; however, bilateral optic edema was remarkable (Fig. ). Serum IL-6 and plasma VEGF levels were assessed in a blood sample obtained on day 9, and both were elevated (25.2 pg/mL and 224 pg/mL, respectively). Abdominal paracentesis was performed on the same day, and the levels of IL-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in ascites were remarkably high (3310 pg/mL and 335 pg/mL, respectively). Bone marrow examination was performed on day 9. Bone marrow aspiration was dry tap, and bone marrow biopsy revealed a mild increase in megakaryocytes and mild reticulin myelofibrosis on silver impregnation staining (Fig. ). Biopsy of a cervical lymph node was performed on day 10, and the pathological findings were compatible with a mixed-type MCD histology (Fig. ). We suspected TAFRO syndrome and methylprednisolone (mPSL) pulse therapy (500 mg/day for three consecutive days) was initiated on day 10 after lymph node biopsy, followed by intravenous PSL (40 mg/day) and oral CsA administration. The disease severity of TAFRO syndrome one day prior to treatment initiation was very severe (grade 5) []. After the initiation of immunosuppressive treatment, the patient became afebrile and the CRP level returned to the normal range within two weeks. However, the patient’s platelet count and serum creatinine level as well as his overall condition did not improve, even after the initiation of immunosuppressive treatment (Fig. ). A central venous catheter was inserted and total parenteral nutrition was started as he could not eat owing to loss of appetite and refusal of tubal feeding. Diuretics, including furosemide, potassium canrenoate, trichlormethiazide, and tolvaptan were administered during hospitalization; however, the amount of ascites did not decrease (Fig. ). Urinalysis performed on day 25 revealed mild proteinuria (0.34 g/day) with a fractional excretion of sodium of 5.1% and a fractional excretion of urea nitrogen (FEUN) of 20.7%. Because urinalysis was performed under diuretics use, considering FEUN level and intravascular hypovolemia on echography, intravenous fluid replacement was performed to correct the pre-renal factor responsible for renal impairment. However, the patient’s volume depletion and blood pressure did not respond well to intravenous fluid replacement. Abdominal paracentesis was again performed on day 40, and it revealed persistently high levels of IL-6 and VEGF (4320 pg/mL and 421 pg/mL, respectively). Although urine volume was initially preserved with diuretic administration, the patient became oliguric from day 47 and anuric from day 49. He was hemodynamically unstable on day 50 (body temperature, 37.5 °C; blood pressure, 84/52 mmHg; heart rate, 109 beats/min; respiratory rate, 24 breaths/min; oxygen saturation, 95% with room air). As the patient was undergoing immunosuppressive therapy and his CRP levels increased by 10.08 mg/dL on the same day, systemic examination was performed to rule out the possibility of infectious disease. Analysis of ascites was performed on the same day, revealing purulent ascites, and Escherichia coli was isolated. E. coli was also isolated from blood cultures. CT of the chest showed a mass in the right lung (Fig. ) in addition to scattered appearance of high intensity regions in the myocardium, which were newly observed (Fig. ). Blood tests performed on day 50 revealed elevated β-d-glucan levels (23.0 pg/mL) and positive cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigenemia (41 cells/5 × 104 WBCs on the C7-HRP test). Aspergillus, Candida mannan, and Cryptococcus neoformans antigens were negative. We suspected bacterial peritonitis and fungal pneumonia. Intravenous meropenem, vancomycin, and caspofungin were initiated on the same day. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) using a polymethyl-methacrylate membrane was also initiated on the same day because anuria did not improve and the patient was hemodynamically unstable. Conditions of CRRT were as follows: mode, continuous hemodiafiltration; dialysis membrane, CH-1.8 W (Toray Medical Co., Ltd., Tokyo Japan); and anticoagulant, nafamostat mesilate. The blood, dialysate, substitute, and filtration flow rates were 100 mL/min, 400 mL/h, 400 mL/h, and 800 mL/h, respectively.\nHowever, approximately 10 h after CRRT initiation, cardiac arrest (ventricular fibrillation followed by pulseless electrical activity) suddenly occurred. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved by cardiopulmonary resuscitation with epinephrine injections. STEMI was suspected from electrocardiography findings obtained immediately after ROSC (Fig. ). Echocardiography performed immediately after ROSC revealed a generalized hypokinesis and akinesia of the anterior wall, septum, and apex without any apparent calcification of the cardiac wall. Blood tests performed after ROSC revealed a slightly elevated serum creatine kinase-MB level (80 U/L, normal range: < 25 U/L) and a remarkably elevated troponin I level (1.2904 ng/mL, normal range: < 0.0262 ng/mL), indicating the acute phase of MI. Emergent coronary angiography (CAG) was performed on the same day. On CAG, complete occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery was observed, and reperfusion was achieved through percutaneous old balloon angioplasty (Fig. ). An intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted to increase coronary blood flow and improve cardiogenic shock. However, even after successful coronary intervention, the patient was still hemodynamically unstable. Despite intensive care, the patient died on day 52.\nAutopsy was performed after obtaining consent from the patient’s relatives. The histological findings of autopsy are shown in Fig. . In this case, multiple infections, including bacterial peritonitis (small abscesses were observed in the abdominal space, and gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods were identified), systemic CMV infection (including the lungs, pancreas, and adrenal glands), and Trichosporon asahii infection in the lungs (T. asahii was isolated from sputum culture) were observed. Intravascular invasion of fungal hyphae was noted in the lungs. On histological evaluation of the heart, coagulation necrosis and neutrophil infiltration were observed, findings that were compatible with MI that occurred a few days before the autopsy. Considering that intravascular invasion of fungal hyphae was observed, embolization caused by fungal hyphae was a possible cause of MI in this case. Necrotic changes were observed in most internal organs. We considered multiple organ failure due to multiple severe infections and circulatory failure due to MI as the main causes of death in this patient. Although there was no stenotic lesion and vascular calcification was not apparent in the left anterior descending coronary artery, myocardial calcification was noted. Calcification in the skeletal muscle cells of the diaphragm and iliopsoas muscle without vascular calcification was also noted. The pathological findings of the kidney were compatible with thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and endothelial injury was noted, although fibrin thrombi were not observed in arterioles. IgA, IgG, and IgM were negative on immunofluorescence. Tubulointerstitial changes could not be evaluated because most of the tissue was necrotic due to changes after death and circulatory failure prior to death. In the bone marrow reevaluation, the number of megakaryocytes did not increase, and reticulin myelofibrosis was not remarkably changed. In the lymph node reevaluation, infiltration of plasma cells was decreased, and immunosuppressive therapy appeared partially effective, although the amount of ascites and IL-6 levels in ascites did not decrease in the present case. Fibrotic changes in the fat tissue of the anterior mediastinum were noted. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 27-year-old man presented to the emergency room with complaints of lightheadedness, dyspnoea, orthopnoea, and bilateral lower extremity oedema over the course of a few weeks. His symptoms were associated with chest discomfort and he denied similar past episodes. He had no significant past medical history. Family history was remarkable for a brother diagnosed with BTHS by genetic testing. The patient denied alcohol use and recreational drug use. He endorsed active cigarette smoking (0.33 packs per day). On presentation, the patient was afebrile with a temperature of 36.7°C, hypotensive to 86/54 mmHg, tachycardic to 104 beats per minute (b.p.m.), breathing at a rate of 18 breaths per minute, with an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. Physical examination was remarkable for diminished breath sounds at the lung bases bilaterally, tachycardia with regular rhythm, jugular venous distension to the earlobe, and 2+ pitting oedema in the lower extremities bilaterally. Complete blood count revealed leukopenia (2.9 k/μL; reference range: 4.0–10.8 k/μL), neutropenia (27.7%; reference range: 43.0–75.0%), and monocytosis (37.1%; reference range: 3.0–12.0%). Lipid panel showed total cholesterol of 91 mg/dL (reference range: 120–200 mg/dL), with a calculated LDL of 44 mg/dL (reference range: 0–99 mg/dL), and an HDL of 22 mg/dL (reference range: 40–59 mg/dL). Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with a ventricular rate of 128 b.p.m., criteria for left atrial enlargement, and a prolonged QTc interval of 589 ms (). The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation, diagnostic interventions, and treatment. Echocardiographic exam revealed enlargement of all four chambers ( and Video 1), with significant dilatation of the left ventricle (end-diastolic diameter 6.0 cm, end-systolic diameter 5.8 cm) and severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15–20%. Additionally, mild pulmonary hypertension was present. Ischaemic workup with coronary angiography revealed patent vessels ( and Video 2), and ventriculogram showed an LVEF of 20%. Right heart catheterization was remarkable for pulmonary arterial pressure of 26/11 mmHg (mean of 16 mmHg), a calculated Fick cardiac output of 3.18 L/min (normal range: 4–8 L/min) and a cardiac index of 2.02 L/min/m2 (normal range 2.5–4 L/min/m2). HIV testing was negative, ethanol level was within normal limits, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was mildly elevated at 5.12 μIU/mL (reference range: 0.4–4.0 μIU/mL), with free T4 within normal limits at 1.16 ng/dL. Based on the history of present illness, family history, physical examination findings, laboratory investigations, and diagnostic imaging results, the patient could likely have a diagnosis of BTHS. He was carefully diuresed to euvolemia, discharged in stable condition with a LifeVest wearable defibrillator for 3 months, and furosemide 20 mg per orum (PO) daily. He was also started on guideline-directed medical therapy including carvedilol 3.125 mg PO twice a day and sacubitril-valsartan 24–26 mg PO twice a day. At a 6-month follow-up visit, the patient had no further complaints, remained compliant with his discharge medications, and spironolactone 12.5 mg PO daily was added. An outpatient cardiac magnetic resonance imaging study with and without contrast for evaluation of infiltrative disease and other causes of non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy was non-suggestive of myocardial infarction, infiltrates, or other abnormal enhancement by late gadolinium enhancement imaging. The patient’s diagnosis was confirmed with outpatient genetic testing for TAZ gene mutation, and he continued to regularly follow-up with an advanced heart failure cardiologist. A repeat echocardiogram (Video 3) 2 years after the initial hospitalization showed evidence of cardiac remodelling with improvement in left ventricular size (end-diastolic diameter 5.02 cm, end-systolic diameter 4.06 cm) and LVEF (45–50%).

    "question": "An 88-year-old woman with a history of dementia, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, hypertension, and chronic cholelithiasis presented with nausea and non-bloody emesis for two days. No abdominal pain, fever, chills, dysuria, hematuria, melena, or hematochezia were exhibited.\nShe was hospitalized three years prior for a similar presentation. At that time, a CT scan was obtained which showed a large stone within the gallbladder (Figure ). During that presentation, the patient refused any surgical intervention and was treated conservatively. One year later, the patient returned with a similar presentation in which a second CT was obtained (Figure ) which showed a gall stone, as well as inflammatory changes and possible duodenal stricture. Thereafter, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and showed duodenopathy with a post-bulbar duodenal stricture. It was thought that the cholelithiasis may have caused inflammatory changes of the duodenum and led to the stricture formation. Pathological examination failed to demonstrate malignancy or Helicobacter pylori infection. She was treated conservatively per her request to avoid surgical intervention.\nExamination on this admission revealed a core temperature of 98.6, a heart rate of 78, a respiratory rate of 16, and an elevated blood pressure of 171/89. The patient had a normal mental status, respiratory, and cardiovascular examination. Abdominal examination was significant for moderate abdominal distention but otherwise unremarkable. Murphy’s sign was negative. There was no guarding or rigidity, no hernia was observed, and no masses or enlarged liver or spleen were palpated. Laboratory investigations were remarkable for an alkaline phosphatase of 283 unit/L (normal: 25 - 100), serum glucose of 171 mg/dl, and leukocytosis of 16.7 with a left shift. In addition, the renal panel was abnormal with a blood urea nitrogen of 33 and creatinine of 6.3. Other hepatic, hematologic, and metabolic studies were unremarkable.\nAn abdominal roentgenogram showed an abnormal gas pattern with distended gastric outline and gastrectasis which was increased compared to her prior studies obtained two years ago. A moderate stool burden was noted throughout the inferior colon and rectum representing fecal impaction. No free air or significant calcification were noted. An abdominal CT scan (Figure ) showed a large 4 cm gallstone in the duodenal bulb with interval development of air within the biliary tree and common duct. A nasogastric tube was placed and drained > 1 liter of dark, red-tinged fluid. Endoscopic studies revealed a normal esophagus, gastric antrum, and pylorus. Debris and fluid were found in the stomach and were suctioned using a gastroscope. A normal duodenal bulb with a large gallstone (4 - 5 cm) at the apex into the duodenal sweep was found. This was surrounded by mucosal edema. Because of the stone angulation, it was difficult to obtain purchase on the stone. Different devices were used in attempts to free the stone from the duodenum and manipulating it into the stomach. Efforts failed due to the calcified nature of the stone, the angulation of the duodenum, extensive inflammatory changes surrounding the stone, and the size of the stone. Subsequently, surgical management was discussed with the patient and her family who agreed to proceed with the operation.\nDiagnostic laparoscopy was attempted but failed due to the difficulty accessing the area of interest laparoscopically. Thus, an exploratory laparotomy was carried out. A midline incision was made and dissection was carried down until the duodenum was once again palpated. Attempts were made trying to move the stone proximally into the stomach; however, there was significant inflammation, as well as adhesions, in the duodenum from the longstanding cholecystitis and cholecystoduodenal fistula. Multiple attempts were made to try to lyse the adhesions, trying to free the angle into the stomach or make it less acute. Despite lysing all the adhesions and performing a limited Kocher maneuver, the attempts to move the stone into the stomach were unsuccessful. The surgical team then attempted to pass the stone more distally in an attempt to take it out through a jejunal enterotomy. The stoned moved freely down to D3/D4, but unfortunately, we were unable to move the stone beyond the ligament of Treitz. The ligament of Treitz was taken down, along with adhesions in the area; however, we were still unable to remove the stone. As there was some hematoma forming in this area, we elected to then proceed with a duodenotomy to retrieve the stone. The stone was moved back to D2, and electrocautery was used to make a 5 cm duodenotomy on the lateral antimesenteric border of the duodenum. The stone was encountered, freed, and extracted from the duodenum (Figure ). Repair of the duodenum and omental flap creation were performed. This was followed by placement of a gastrojejunostomy feeding tube. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 62-year-old female patient underwent a laparoscopic anterior resection procedure for sigmoid colon cancer. The patient who was discharged on postoperative day four uneventfully presented with complaints of abdominal pain, distended abdomen, nausea, and fever lasting for 24 hours on 4th day after discharge. Her past medical and surgical history was unremarkable except for a previous diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus for which she received prednisolone 16 mg/day as treatment.\nOn physical examination, she had fever at 38.7 C, blood pressure was 110/60 mm/Hg, heart rate was 100/min, and the respiratory rate was 18/min. She was in mild/acute distress and she was alert and oriented. Abdominal examination was notable for distention, hypoactive bowel sounds, and tenderness in all quadrants. There was guarding and rebound in the lower quadrants of the abdomen.\nLaboratory evaluation was remarkable for leukocytosis 18,000/mm3 (4500–10,000/mm3), and highly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels of 372 mg/dL (normal range < 5 mg/dL). All other laboratory parameters including electrolytes and renal and liver function tests were within the normal range. A computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed extravasation of luminal contrast from the anastomosis level into the pelvic region (). In addition, a collection of fluid measuring 8 × 5 cm was noticed in the pelvis. There was associated free air in the peritoneum.\nA diagnosis of peritonitis due to anastomosis leakage was made and urgent surgical intervention was recommended. The laparoscopic approach was planned. The abdomen was entered laparoscopically via the previous trocar sites. On laparoscopic exploration, the anastomosis site was characterized with small bowel adhesions covered with layers of fibrin clots and purulent fluid accumulation in the pelvic region. Aspiration of the purulent fluid was performed followed by separation of the small bowel adhesions. A 1 cm colon peritoneal fistula covered with fibrin layers was identified at the anastomosis site, which localized intraperitoneally. There was no fecal contamination. The abdomen was irrigated with isotonic saline solution and a complete decontamination of the pelvic contents was performed. After adequate drainage of pelvic collection, a drain was placed through the port site at the left lower quadrant across the anastomosis site into the pelvic region and the procedure was ended. The need for an ostomy was precluded as an endoscopic stent was planned for the closure of the anastomosis site. However, because our endoscopy unit had not been work at night time as emergency services, the patient was sent to the endoscopy unit on 5th hour after the operation.\nAt sigmoidoscopy, the anastomosis site with 1 cm fistula was identified at 17 cm above the anal verge (). To close the fistula, a 12 cm long partially coated SEMS (Hanarostent Duodenum/Pylorus Lasso, NCN, MI Tech Co., Seoul, South Korea) was placed across the site of leak successfully (). The patient was placed on prophylactic treatment with a third generation cephalosporin and intravenous metronidazole. A dramatic decrease in the patients fever and leukocytosis was observed 24 hours after the procedure. Abdominal pain gradually resolved and oral feeding was started. Abdominal drainage which started at a rate of 150–200 cc/day ceased after 5 days. Follow-up CT demonstrated complete resolution of the anastomosis leak and abscess. The drain was removed and stent removal was planned at four weeks after the procedures. On the seventh postoperative day, the patient was discharged uneventfully. Twenty-four days after the procedure, the patient presented again. She reported an incident of the stent falling out and passing in bowel motion. Sigmoidoscopy was performed and it was consistent with a complete healing of the anastomosis site, while the absence of the stent in the previously inserted location was confirmed (). During follow-up, the patients remained well with no complaints with defecation. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 74-year-old male with a history of mild cognitive impairment presented to the emergency department with failure to thrive and generalized weakness of three weeks duration. He was having difficulty swallowing which he related to a poorly fitted denture. He had thirty pounds of unintentional weight loss in the last three months due to loss of appetite. His past medical history was significant for diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, major depressive disorder, chronic pain syndrome, and hepatitis C. His social history was significant for 12.5 pack-year smoking and drinking (two to three glasses of wine/day). He denied any utilization of recreational drugs. In the emergency department, his vital signs were, BP-104/59 mmHg, HR-97 bpm, respiratory rate-14/minute, temperature-97.4 °F, and oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. He weighed 40 kg, and his BMI was 13.84 kg/m2. On physical examination, he was alert, oriented, and appeared weak and malnourished. The ill-fitted complete maxillary denture was removed. The oral cavity examination revealed a large (3 × 2 cm2) defect with an erythematous border that encompassed the mid-palatal structures and emanated from the hard palate into his nasal cavity (Figure ).\nThere was no discrete mass or ulcer and mucosa surrounding this defect appeared normal. On palpation, the lesion was non-tender without any palpable lymph node on the head and neck examination. His lungs, heart, neurological, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Laboratory data at admission showed Hb-11.7 g/dl, WBC’s-9.6 K/CMM, and platelets-190 K/CMM. The chemistry panel (BMP) was within the normal range. AST-23 U/L, ALT-25 U/L, and serum alkaline phosphatase were 114 U/L. Auto-immune work-up including anti-dsDNA, anti-proteinase-3 antibodies, myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibodies were negative.

Contrast-enhanced CT of the neck demonstrates enlarged level 2A lymph nodes bilaterally (Figure and 2B), corresponding to increased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity on PET CT (Figure ).\nA biopsy of the palatal lesion was performed, which showed SCC (well-differentiated), with parakeratosis, acute, and chronic inflammation (Figure ).\nImmunohistochemistry by p16 shows diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic staining of well-differentiated SCC (Figure ). PD-L1 test showed a combined positive score of 10-15. CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis were negative for metastasis. NM bone scan showed radiotracer uptake in paranasal sinuses/facial bones. PET scan showed diffuse FDG activity in the hard palate, mildly hypermetabolic cervical, pretracheal, subcarinal, and left hilar nodes with minimal FDG activity. A diagnosis of locally advanced (stage IVa) oral cavity SCC was made. The patient was evaluated by a multidisciplinary team including an oncologist, head and neck surgeon, maxillofacial surgeon, radiation oncologist, and nutritionist for further management. The patient underwent prosthetic rehabilitation. A palatal obturator (prosthesis) was placed to improve his speech, eating, and prevent regurgitation.

    "question": "A 77-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with intractable nausea and bilious and non-bloody vomiting of one-day duration. This was associated with diffuse abdominal pain which he described as dull, non-radiating, and moderate in severity. His symptoms were exacerbated by oral intake. Prior to his presentation, he had normal bowel movements. He denied chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, dysphagia, diarrhea, or constipation. Past medical and surgical histories were noncontributory. The patient previously smoked 1.5 packs per day for 20 years but quit 31 years ago. He reported moderate alcohol use and denied illicit drug use.\nThree weeks prior to his presentation to the emergency department, he was diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic adenocarcinoma. He did not receive chemotherapy and elected for conservative management as well as palliative care. One day prior to his presentation, he underwent EUS-guided CPN for palliation of his debilitating pain. The procedure involved injecting bupivacaine and 98% absolute alcohol under general anesthesia to induce unilateral celiac plexus neurolysis. There were no immediate post-procedure complications, and the patient was discharged home in a stable condition soon after completion of the neurolysis. Of note, the patient was using oxycodone 5 mg oral tablets three times per day as needed for pain since his cancer diagnosis. In the last three weeks prior to the procedure, he did not complain of nausea or constipation. He also denied taking the medication more frequently than usual.\nIn the emergency department, vital signs demonstrated blood pressure of 115/73 mmHg, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37.2℃. Abdominal exam was significant for minimal epigastric tenderness without guarding or rebound tenderness. The remainder of the physical exam was noncontributory. Complete blood count (CBC) showed white blood cell (WBC) of 10.0 × 103/µL, hemoglobin of 12.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 295 × 103/µL. Basic metabolic panel (BMP) showed sodium of 135 mmol/L, potassium of 5.1 mmol/L, chloride of 96 mmol/L, creatinine of 1.34 mg/dL, glucose of 384 mg/dL, and anion gap of 9 mmol/L. Liver function tests showed aspartate transaminase (AST) of 12 U/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) of 17 U/L, alkaline phosphatase of 74 U/L, and total bilirubin of 0.4 mg/dL. Lipase was within reference range at 5.0 U/L. Urinalysis did not reveal ketones. Hemoglobin A1c was unremarkable at 5.4% and glucose levels normalized without treatment, suggesting that the initial hyperglycemia was probably related to stress.\nThe patient initially received intravenous fluids and was placed on a bowel rest regimen. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed significant gastric distension, which was concerning for obstruction at the level of the duodenum (Figure ).\nNext, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed large amounts of fluids within the gastric fundus and body, which was also concerning for duodenal obstruction. The examined first and second parts of the duodenum were normal (Figure ).\nAs a result, upper gastrointestinal series with barium swallow was performed to look for an obstruction distal to the second part of the duodenum. Although it showed delayed gastric emptying of the contrast, contrast was seen in the third part of the duodenum and jejunum ruling out a complete obstruction in the duodenum (Figure ).\nFinally, a push enteroscopy was performed to visualize the entire duodenum. It showed angulation in the third part of the duodenum but no obstruction or mucosal abnormalities in the third or fourth parts of the duodenum (Figure ).\nAt that point, extensive gastrointestinal workup ruled out small bowel obstruction, and the diagnosis of ileus was made. The patient received ondansetron and polyethylene glycol as needed, and his diet was advanced slowly. His symptoms improved over the course of a few days, and he experienced a return of normal bowel activity. He eventually tolerated a regular diet and was discharged home in a stable condition.

    "question": "In December 2019, a right-handed 38-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with increasing right shoulder pain and raised inflammatory parameters. Her past medical history was remarkable for paraplegia due to poliomyelitis in childhood and a residual epilepsy due to the sequelae of a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Apart from these conditions, for which she was wheelchair-bound, this patient was in good general health with a previous non-pathologic and well-functioning right shoulder.\nOne month prior to her admission with shoulder pain, she was involved in a car accident as a result of a tonic-clonic seizure. Upon admission, she developed hypertension with associated proteinuria and was diagnosed with a 26-week gestation previously unknown pregnancy and pre-eclampsia. She was previously nulliparous. At day six of hospitalization, the patient presented a spontaneous placental abruption and underwent an emergency caesarean section with a simple post-operative evolution.\nPhysical exam of her right upper extremity revealed a swollen, warm and painful right shoulder on palpation and mobilization without neurovascular disorder. On general examination, she had moderate asthenia without disorientation. The vital signs were: Temperature of 37.2 °C, heart rate at 104 beats per minute, blood pressure of 148/95 mmHg, respiratory rate at 23 per minute and an oxygen saturation within the norm (SpO2 95% breathing ambient air).\nHemoglobin was 101 G/L, leukocytes 9.8 G/L, thrombocytes 305 G/L and C-reactive protein was increased to 271 mg/L. Blood cultures were sent for culture.\nSuspecting right shoulder septic arthritis without any degenerative sign on X-ray (Fig. ), she underwent open surgical debridement, synovectomy and 9 L saline solution lavage of the right shoulder by a delto-pectoral approach with subscapularis tenotomy. Abundant pus at arthrotomy was observed with the observation of a stage 3 equivalent according to Gächter’s classification [].\nAwaiting culture results, empirical antibiotic treatment with intravenous 2,2 g 3td amoxicilline and clavulanic acid was initiated.\nWhilst the blood cultures and intra-operative cultures remained sterile (Fig. ) without any crystals positivity on microscopic analysis, the clinical evolution was unfavorable with persistent pain, inflammation and purulent drainage. The patient required two additional surgical debridements and lavages on days 4 and day 7 after the first surgery. Both surgical interventions revealed persistent amounts of purulent and fibrous material despite the previous procedures and the empirical antibiotic treatment.\nThe 16S ribosomal RNA PCR performed on the purulent intra-operative liquid revealed U. urealyticum at 2.95 × 106 copies/ml (Fig. ), positive specific cultures inoculated a posteriori confirmed this finding (Fig. ).\nCervical smear showed no simultaneous U. urealyticum genital infection. Fresh placental tissue was not available for further testing, but there was no evident macroscopic chorio-amnionitis.\nUpon receiving the microbiological documentation, a bi-therapy of levofloxacin and azithromycine was initiated. Susceptibility testing showed an intermediate sensibility to ciprofloxacin and clarithromycin. The strain was susceptible to doxycycline. Following cessation of breastfeeding, we started treatment with doxycycline for 4 weeks according to the guidelines of our institution and on the basis of the low initial therapeutic response []. Early mobilization was started with our physiotherapist (Fig. ). She showed a favorable course with an excellent biological and functional outcome with a post-surgical DASH score of 5,8 at 3 months follow-up []. As a reminder, a DASH score of 0 represents no disability and a score of 100 represents severe disability after surgery. Concerning the father of the infant, no other specific considerations were taken related to this infection. The infant presented good clinical evolution.

Four months prior to this admission, he had visited to the Department of ENT at another hospital with the complaint of nasal stuffiness. At that time, the serologic testing for hepatitis B antigen and anti-HIV antibody were positive. He has been treated with zidovudine, lamivudine and efavirenz for two months until admission. He assumed that his AIDS was transmitted from heterosexual contact at abroad ten years ago. On admission, the blood pressure was 120/70 mmHg, the pulse rate 90/min, the respiratory rate 20/min and the body temperature was 36.6℃. He was icteric on the physical examination. The liver was tender and firm in consistency. It was palpated at a three-finger breadth below the right costal margin. His spleen and lymph nodes were not enlarged. The laboratory results were normal apart from an ESR of 120 mm/h; leukopenia 3,930/mm3 (neutrophils: 58.8%, lymphocytes: 31% and monocytes: 8.4%) and hemoglobin 9.4 g/dL. The liver function tests were abnormal: total bilirubin 8.9 mg/dL (direct bilirubin: 6.05 mg/dL), AST 171 IU/L, ALT 100 IU/L and LDH 1063 IU/L. The total number of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes was 290/mm3 and 568/mm3, respectively, and the ratio of CD4/CD8 was 0.51. Abdominal enhanced CT scanning revealed multifocal and variable sized homogenous hypodense masses in both hepatic lobes (). A liver biopsy showed a heavy infiltration composed mainly of large lymphoid cells (). Immunohistochemical staining revealed the atypical cells to be CD20 positive (), which established a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma according to the WHO classification. Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated normal cellularity with normal maturation of all three cell lines. There was no malignant cell infiltration. After the patient was diagnosed as having diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, he received VAD (vincristine 0.4 mg, adriamycin 9 mg/m2, dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1-4, and additional dexamethasone on days 9-12 and days 17-20). The patient seemed to show a little clinical improvement, but before starting the second chemotherapy, he developed signs of spinal cord compression (). Emergency radiation therapy was delivered to the spine lesion. CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, adriamycin 50 mg/m2 and vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 on day 1 and prednisone 100 mg/m2 on days 1-5) and laminectomy induced temporary improvement (). Alas, the paraplegia continued and his clinical condition progressively worsened. He passed away 103 days after starting the second round of chemotherapy from complications of pressure sores, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism.
