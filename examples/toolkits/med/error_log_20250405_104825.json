    "question": "A 59-year-old Hispanic male patient with a medical history of hypertension, obesity, and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (last HbA1c was 13%) presented to the emergency department for fever of 20 days duration and worsening cough with expectoration, as well as progressive respiratory distress. On admission, his vital signs were a blood pressure of 144/83 mmHg, heart rate of 74 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 50 breaths per minute, O2 saturation of 40% (room air), and temperature of 38 °C. On physical examination, he was found to be febrile, somnolent, and polypneic, with marked respiratory effort. Emergency orotracheal intubation and transfer to the intensive care unit were necessary.\nInitial screening showed thrombocytopenia (platelet count 138 × 103 cells/µl), leukocytosis (WBC 15,760 cells/ml, 90% neutrophils) with lymphopenia (6.20% lymphocytes), elevated transaminases (ALT 1507.4 IU and AST 3049.7 IU), elevated d-dimer (44,066 µg/ml), and negative RT-PCR SARS CoV-2 test. Chest X-ray showed extensive interstitial infiltrates in both lung fields (Fig. b). Considering the progressive decrease in total platelet count as well as gradual lymphopenia (Fig. ), a dengue IgM/IgG test was conducted and was positive, while the dengue PCR-RT test was negative. According to radiographic findings and respiratory involvement, the RT-PCR test for SARS CoV-2 was repeated on two more occasions, with negative results. Therefore, IgG antibodies for SARS CoV-2 were assayed and were positive.\nPositive serology for both SARS CoV-2 and dengue virus confirmed coinfection, so it was considered that he had probably entered a late stage of the disease. Steroid management was indicated according to COVID-19 management guidelines, in addition to pronation cycles, to which he presented poor response and persistent hypoxemia. During his stay in intensive care, he presented multiple complications, such as acute pulmonary embolism, with signs of secondary thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, bacterial superinfection in his lungs by Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Akin III acute renal failure. Computerized tomography angiography of the chest was performed, which confirmed acute pulmonary thromboembolism of multiple bilateral lobar and segmental bilateral branches with signs of secondary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary changes suggestive of organizing pneumonia secondary to viral infection (Fig. ). Details of the clinical description of the coinfection are presented in Table . The patient remained in the ICU for COVID-19, bacterial superinfection, and dengue with alarm signs for 63 days. His progression was slow, showing progressive clinical deterioration. He required prolonged mechanical ventilation and vasopressor management until he finally died.

    "question": "A previously healthy 55-year-old woman with confirmed COVID-19 infection was hospitalised due to fatigue and near-syncope. Nine days prior to admission, her daughter returned from another European country and 3 days thereafter the daughter developed upper airways symptoms. The next day (day 0), the patient developed fatigue and unspecific body discomfort, with no airway symptoms. COVID-19 was confirmed in both the next days. Her medical condition improved temporarily until hospitalisation on day 7 due to several episodes of near-syncope and increased body and chest discomfort.\nBy admittance to hospital, the patient was isolated due to the COVID-19 infection. Blood pressure was 102/72 mm Hg, heart rate was 100 beats/min, respiratory rate was 17/min and rectal temperature was 37.2°C. Clinical examination revealed normal organ findings including pulmonary and cardiac examination. The ECG showed sinus tachycardia, insignificant ST-elevation in inferior leads and T-wave inversion in precordial leads (). Furthermore, there was low-voltage ECG with peak-to-peak QRS amplitude less than 5 mm in the standard leads and 10 mm in the precordial leads (V5 and V6). All ECG findings were stationary during the course. Laboratory findings showed glucose 7.2 mmol/L, normal electrolytes, mild elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP) 11 and significantly elevated leucocyte count 13.2×109/L, troponin T 108 ng/L, NT-proBNP 1025 ng/L. Comprehensive description of laboratory tests and therapy is shown in . Bedside cardiac ultrasound examination performed by the on-call cardiac resident using a hand-held ultrasound device revealed moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, reduced left ventricular EF, dilated inferior caval vein with reduced respiratory variation and pericardial effusion at a maximum of 18 mm, a small right ventricle and a slight impression of the right atrium (). She was subsequently transferred to the ICU and treated with fluid support and norepinephrine. Day to day fluid and pressor treatment are highlighted in . The results of the point-of-care ultrasound examination were confirmed by echocardiography at the ICU. The left ventricle presented with a moderate concentric hypertrophy with a small cavity with end-diastolic volume less than 70 mL. Furthermore, there was a striking hyperechogenic pattern of the endocardium and epicardium ( and ). She deteriorated the following day with decreasing blood pressure and diuresis, with only a modest response on supportive treatment with fluid and pressor (norepinephrine (NA) and dobutamine). Fluid support was provided due to extensive peripheral capillary leakage. The extremities were cold and wet, but cognition was normal and beside international normalization ratio (INR) 1.2–1.3 there was no other sign of organ failure. Pericardiocentesis was performed at day 9 due to subacute deterioration and echocardiographic signs of a tamponade including compression of the right atrium, dilated inferior vena cava without inspiratory diameter reduction and respiratory variation in volumes and flow velocities ( and ). After initial drainage of 300 mL of serosal pericardial fluid, there was an immediate reduction of the respiratory variation of inflow patterns. The systolic blood pressure increased from 60 mm Hg to 95 mm Hg followed by increased diuresis. Size and function of the cardiac chambers together with mitral inflow pattern and filling of the left ventricle normalised gradually over the following days (, ). The left ventricular myocardial thickness and striking echogenicity were reduced in the same period. Cardiac output and blood pressure improved correspondingly. The patient needed supportive fluid therapy due to capillary leakage until day 15 when she was transferred to the ward.\nThe pericardial fluid tested negative in PCR for COVID-19. Cardiac (CMRI) study performed at day 15 was consistent with the diagnosis of acute perimyocarditis. T1-mapping showed relaxation times of 1260–1270 ms in the anterolateral wall compared with 1090 ms in the septum. The corresponding T2-mapping relaxation times were 60–61 ms and 52–53 ms, respectively. Inversion recovery sequences showed a moderate epicardial late gadolinium enhancement in the anterolateral wall (). Myocardial biopsy was postponed due to the COVID-19 situation and rapid improvement. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 72-year-old man with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and prostate cancer accompanied by multiple bone metastasis had sudden chest and back pain and difficulty in breathing at rest. His chest pain was accompanied by heaviness, squeezing, and discomfort. His prostate cancer had been treated with bicalutamide (80 mg/day) for ∼2 years, and his cancer stage was stable. He was brought to our hospital by ambulance and his vital signs were as follows: heart rate 72/min, respiratory rate 24/min, an axillary temperature 36.2°C, saturation of percutaneous oxygen under room air 90%, and peak blood pressure of 190/108 mmHg. There was no pleural effusion or congestion in the chest radiograph (). Electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with a complete right bundle branch block (CRBBB) and no significant ST-segment changes (). His initial serum troponin I level was 0.05 ng/mL (normal value: <0.04 ng/mL) and the d-dimer level was 14.7 μg/mL (normal value: <1.0 μg/mL). White blood cell count was 12 900/μL (normal value: 4000–7500/μL) and brain natriuretic peptide was 110 pg/mL (normal value: <18.4 pg/mL); other laboratory values were within normal range. The echocardiogram did not show any wall motion abnormality, significant valve disease, right ventricle dilation, or obvious congenital heart disease such as a patent foramen ovale. His chest CT with contrast showed bilateral scattered PE and left deep vein thrombus (from popliteal vein to soleus vein) (). After admission, his chest pain persisted, and the serum troponin I level and ECG were checked repeatedly. Although his serial ECG did not show no significant changes (), his serum troponin I level 3 h after the admission was elevated to 0.90 ng/mL. Furthermore, reconstruction of the SDCT (IQon Spectral CT; Philips healthcare) images clearly showed a perfusion defect of the posterolateral left ventricle myocardium (), suggesting a combination of PE and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).\nFollowing these findings, coronary angiogram was then performed which showed total occlusion of the OM branch. Although atherosclerotic plaques were seen in multiple coronary arteries, significant stenosis was not observed except for the OM branch (). Consequently, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed to the occlusion site. After thrombectomy, intracoronary imaging using intravascular ultrasound was performed, and atherosclerotic plaque lesions were observed (). Two drug-eluting stents were deployed (Synergy 2.75/28 mm and Synergy 2.25/20 mm), and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 3 flow was achieved (). The creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB peaked at 2034 and 278 IU/L (normal values: CK 60–287 IU/L and CK-MB <25 IU/L) 8 h after the admission.\nFollowing treatment of ACS, we began treatment for PE with an oral anticoagulant (OAC, rivaroxaban 30 mg/day). He was relieved of his chest symptoms and was rescued from a hypoxic state. He was discharged on the 14th day after admission. Enhanced SDCT and associated reconstructed images of effective atomic number (Z-effective) 6 months after the treatment started, until when dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 100 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg/day) and OAC therapy (rivaroxaban 30 mg/day for 3 weeks and 15 mg/day after 3 weeks) were continued, showed improvement in perfusion defects in both pulmonary fields () and the myocardium (). His treatment was deescalated to single antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel 75 mg/day) and OAC, and he has had a good course without recurrence.

Examination of the eyes and skin revealed icterus.\nInitial laboratory investigations revealed thrombocytopenia (hemoglobin 13.0 g/dL, white cell count 3.4 × 103/μL, platelet count 9.1 × 104/μL). Electrolytes were normal (Na 139 mmol/L, K 4.2 mmol/L, Cl 103 mmol/L, Ca 9.5 mg/dL, Mg 2.3 mg/dL, P 3.9 mg/dL). Her coagulation profile was prolonged (prothrombin time 23%, prothrombin time-international normalized ratio 2.36, activated partial thromboplastin time 63.7 s) and liver function tests were abnormal (albumin 4.0 g/dL, total bilirubin 18.76 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 13.17 mg/dL, venous ammonia 70 μg/dL, lactate 2.2 mmol/L). Infectious disease screening tests were negative. Computed tomography (CT) scan of her abdomen showed lower absorption in the liver compared to the spleen, suggesting ALF. Cranial CT scan and fundus examination were normal. Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed slow spindle waves with a frequency of 1–2 Hz, without laterality or triphasic waves (Fig. a). Daily plasma exchange and continuous hemodiafiltration were started for ALF with HE. Mannitol was administered to prevent cerebral edema. A day before surgery, GCS scores worsened to E1VTM1. Clinically, she was unresponsive to pain and auditory stimuli, and her EEG showed high voltage continuous slow waves with a frequency of 0.5–1 Hz, without lateralization (Fig. b). Assuming deterioration of HE, emergency LT was considered vital. After obtaining informed consent from her family, urgent living donor LT with an extended left liver graft from her mother was planned on the 5th ICU day.\nGeneral anesthesia was induced with fentanyl (50 mcg) and rocuronium (20 mg) and maintained with remifentanil and rocuronium infusions (0.1–0.4 mcg/kg/min and 7 mcg/kg/min, respectively), along with sevoflurane inhalation at 0.5%. A BIS Quatro Brain Monitoring Sensor (Medtronic plc, Dublin, Ireland) was placed on the frontotemporal region, and her electroencephalogram, including BIS values, 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF95), and suppression ratio (SR), was continuously recorded at each phase of liver transplantation by the BIS monitor until the end of anesthesia (Fig. , Fig. a–d). The durations of anesthesia and surgery were 708 min and 637 min, respectively. The graft volume was 254 g, graft volume/recipient standard liver volume (GV/SLV) was 46.1%, and graft-to-recipient weight ratio (GRWR) was 1.27%. Warm and cold ischemia times were 40 min and 51 min, respectively. BIS values ranged from 10 to 20 from the start of the operation to reperfusion (Fig. ). From reperfusion to the end of the operation, BIS values ranged from 10 to 80, and the variation in BIS values also increased. The frequency of EEG waveforms and BIS values seen with BIS monitoring gradually increased (Fig. ). She was re-admitted to the PICU after surgery, extubated on postoperative day (POD) 2 and discharged from the PICU on POD 7. Follow-up EEG on POD 5 showed low amplitude and fast waves with a frequency of 9–10 Hz, without laterality or paroxysmal waves (Fig. c). However, she spoke only a few words until POD 7. Two weeks postoperatively, she was newly diagnosed with hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia. Her immunosuppressant regimen was changed and continued for post liver transplantation prophylaxis and aplastic anemia. She was discharged after 4 months of hospitalization. The cause of liver failure in the present case remains unknown. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 53-year-old Korean man who had undergone curative surgical resection for stage iii (T3N2M0) colon cancer was evaluated in clinic by his medical oncologist before the start of adjuvant chemotherapy. He appeared clinically well on assessment and proceeded to receive his first cycle of modified folfox-6 chemotherapy. This regimen consisted of oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, folinic acid 400 mg/m2, and 5-fluorouracil (5-fu) 400 mg/m2 bolus on day 1, followed by 5-fu 2400 mg/m2 by continuous infusion over the next 46 hours. Dexamethasone 12 mg and ondansetron 8 mg were given as pre-medication before chemotherapy.\nThe patient experienced no acute side effects or complications in the chemotherapy unit. He was discharged home with an ambulatory 5-fu pump and was scheduled to return to the clinic at completion of his 5-fu infusion.\nTwenty-four hours later, the patient presented to the emergency department with new symptoms of erratic behaviour and confusion. Collateral history from the accompanying family members revealed that he had suffered a brief generalized tonic–clonic seizure earlier in the day, but no apparent history of head injuries, infectious symptoms, or recent alcohol intake was present. The patient’s other medical problems included well-controlled hypertension, hyperlipidemia, polycystic kidney disease, chronic renal insufficiency (baseline creatinine: 172 mmol/L), and stable chronic hepatitis B carrier status without laboratory or radiologic evidence of cirrhosis. No history of epilepsy was present. The patient’s only oral medications were amlodipine, quinapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and atorvastatin. He was an ex-smoker, and he denied alcohol abuse and illicit drugs.\nOn examination in the emergency department, the patient was neither alert nor oriented. He was unable to follow commands, and his verbal responses were incomprehensible. He was agitated, and his limbs were tremulous at rest. Temperature was 35.9°C; heart rate, 82/min; respirations, 18/min; blood pressure, 130/84 mmHg; and O2 saturation on room air, 99%. The patient’s eyes appeared deviated to his left side, but pupils were equal and reactive. Spontaneous twitching of the extremities, on the left side more than on the right, was noted and attributed to possible complex partial seizures. No other focal neurologic deficits or evidence of trauma were present. The Brudzinski and Kernig signs were negative. Examinations of chest, heart, and abdomen were otherwise unremarkable. The patient was noted to be incontinent of urine during the assessment. He was treated with intravenous diazepam and phenytoin (given in a loading dose of 1000 mg) for his agitation and presumed seizure activity respectively. At this point, his 5-fu infusion pump was still attached and functioning.\nLaboratory investigations showed leucocytosis (white blood cell count: 19.5 × 109/L) with left shift, but an otherwise normal complete blood cell count. Liver enzyme tests were within normal limits. Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were elevated (239 mmol/L and 8.6 mmol/L respectively). Metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 29 mmol/L was present. Imaging of the head and brain by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scan respectively did not demonstrate evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, mass, or other abnormalities. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was benign, and subsequent cultures of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and urine were all negative. Of note, serum ammonia, at 316 mmol/L, and serum lactate, at 8.3 mmol/L, were elevated. The remainder of the toxicology screen was completely unremarkable. Vitamin B12 level and thyroid function tests were normal. An electroencephalogram showed a generalized slowing pattern consistent with metabolic encephalopathy.\nOver the next 8 hours, the patient’s mental status progressively deteriorated to a comatose state. The 5-fu infusion pump was discontinued. Because the patient was no longer adequately protecting his airway, the critical care team was consulted for patient intubation and admission to the intensive care unit. With an apparent cause for the rapidly progressive cognitive dysfunction still lacking, lactulose at a dose of 30 mL every 4 hours was administered by nasogastric tube shortly thereafter in an effort to correct the patient’s encephalopathy. Phenytoin was continued.\nFollowing the cessation of 5-fu and administration of lactulose, the patient gradually recovered over the next 48 hours from his acute confusional state. He experienced significant fatigue and muscle weakness, but no further seizures. Successive ammonia levels showed a decreasing trend. The patient was extubated, and phenytoin was discontinued. This man was discharged home on day 8 with instructions to follow up with his medical oncologist the following week.\nAfter discharge, the patient required several weeks to recuperate before he could embark on additional chemotherapy. Considering his presumed neuropsychiatric complication from folfox chemotherapy, raltitrexed (3 mg/m2) and oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2) were given every 3 weeks as adjuvant treatment instead. This therapy was provided on an inpatient basis because of the insistence of the patient. No significant adverse reactions were noted. Unfortunately, re-staging investigations shortly thereafter revealed three metastatic lesions in the liver. We plan to continue with further chemotherapy for this patient with the goal of potential resection of his liver lesions in the future. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 32-year-old female with a past medical history of obesity (body mass index of 42) and gastroesophageal reflux disease, not on home medications, presented to the emergency department complaining of worsening shortness of breath for two days. The patient was in her usual state of health until seven days before presentation, when she developed a dry cough, fever, chills, and malaise. She worked as a certified nursing assistant at a nursing home facility where a few cases of COVID-19 had been detected recently.\nIn the emergency department, her initial vital signs were as follows: temperature 99°F, pulse 106 beats per minute, blood pressure 107/70 mmHg, respiratory rate 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 70% on room air. Physical examination revealed an alert and oriented patient (Glasgow Coma Scale 15), with bilateral wheezing but otherwise unremarkable physical findings. She was promptly placed on nasal cannula and subsequently on nonrebreather 100% FiO2, with an improvement of her oxygen saturation to 95%.\nHer initial laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 10.9 K/µL (normal range [NR] 3.8-10.8 K/µL), absolute lymphocyte count of 0.64 K/µL (NR 0.85-3.9 K/µL), hemoglobin 14.1 g/dL (NR 13.2-17.1 g/dL), platelets 214 K/µL (NR 140-400 K/µL), C-reactive protein 30.94 mg/dL (NR < 0.80 mg/dL), ferritin 998 µg/L, lactic acid 3.3 mmol/L (NR 0.5-2.2 mmol/L), lactate dehydrogenase 556 U/L (NR 125-220 U/L), troponin was negative (NR < 0.30 ng/mL), creatinine 1.0 mg/dL (NR 0.7-1.3 mg/dL), Na 138 mmol/L (NR 135-145 mmol/L), K 3.4 mmol/L (NR 3.5-5.1 mmol/L), and high-sensitivity D-dimer 806 ng/mL (NR < 231 ng/mL).\nThe chest radiograph obtained in the emergency department demonstrated multiple rounded and peripheral ground-glass opacities throughout the lung fields (Figure ).\nA nasopharyngeal swab was performed and tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. Due to severe hypoxia, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). On hospital day 2, she underwent intubation and mechanical ventilation for worsening tachypnea and respiratory distress. The patient was started on intravenous steroids (methylprednisolone 40 mg every eight hours), received a dose of tocilizumab 400 mg, and completed a five-day course of hydroxychloroquine (800 mg/day for one day, then 400 mg/day for four days) and azithromycin (500 mg/day for one day, then 250 mg/day for four days).\nOn hospital day 3, her renal function worsened, and her creatinine peaked at 2.4 mg/dL, likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis. However, she remained with good urine output and no significant metabolic acidosis. Her creatinine gradually improved on the subsequent days, returning to the baseline renal function. The patient remained stable hemodynamically and sedated with hydromorphone and ketamine, but despite the optimized medical management she continued to spike fevers at 102°F, and repeated chest imaging with CT on day 5 showed significant worsening bilateral ground-glass airspace opacities (Figure ).\nOn hospital day 7, she received convalescent plasma transfusion and started on vancomycin after respiratory cultures demonstrated the presence of Staphylococcus aureus infection. On hospital day 8, the patient had an episode of oxygen desaturation to 75% with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 79, despite being on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 100% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 12 cm H2O. She was bagged by the respiratory therapist for over one hour and given the failure of mechanical ventilation to provide adequate oxygenation, the decision was to start VV-ECMO.\nThe patient’s left femoral vein was cannulated with a 28-Fr heparin-coated cannula for blood return and the left internal jugular vein was cannulated with a 21-Fr cannula for blood access. The patient was placed on VV-ECMO (CentriMag [Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA, USA] short-term external circulatory device) with initial settings of flow 4.5 liters per minute, speed 3,300 revolutions per minute, and ECMO FiO2 100%, sweep three liters per minute. She was started on heparin drip, received infusion of neuromuscular blocking agent cisatracurium for a short period, and then remained sedated with hydromorphone and lorazepam. She continued to have episodes of fevers up to 101°F, and repeated sputum cultures demonstrated the presence of Acinetobacter species and Proteus mirabilis, while blood cultures were negative. She was placed on cefepime for ventilator-associated pneumonia and the episodes of fevers gradually improved.\nOn the following two weeks, the patient was gradually able to wean down VV-ECMO settings, decreasing ECMO FiO2 to 40%, and flow to 3.6 liters per minute. On hospital day 20, she had a transvenous pacemaker placed due to several episodes of bradycardia with pauses lasting up to 19 seconds during oral care, likely vagally mediated. On hospital day 21, a bronchoscopy was performed and showed minimal secretions and no mucus plug. Given her prolonged time intubated, she underwent tracheostomy placement on hospital day 22. On hospital day 26, the patient was finally able to have VV-ECMO explanted, after 18 days of extracorporeal therapy. As she continued to improve clinically, the mechanical ventilation was successfully weaned off on hospital day 38. The patient was noted to have no neurological deficits, and was able to be downgraded from ICU to the medical ward on the following day. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 21-year-old female patient with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department with presyncope. Three weeks prior to her presentation, she tested positive for COVID-19 infection after developing symptoms of shortness of breath and chest pain. She was quarantined at her home and treated symptomatically with improvement. She never required hospitalization for her symptoms nor medications. She denied smoking and alcohol or illicit drug use along with any other medication that could cause QT interval prolongation. Upon her presentation, her physical examination was noted to be significant for bradycardia. Her vitals were blood pressure of 118/63 mmHg, a heart rate of 45 bpm, a temperature of 98.3 °F, and a respiratory rate of 18 sating 100% on room air. Her electrocardiogram showed 45 bpm with narrow QRS complex and premature atrial complexes.\nSignificant laboratory results included a WBC of 18.24 k/μL (3.60–9.50), troponin negative at <0.03 ng/mL (≤0.04), normal TSH at 3.79 uIU/mL (0.34–5.60), CRP at 27.00 mg/L (≤10.00), ESR at 51 mm/h (0–20), procalcitonin at <0.02 ng/mL (0.00–0.10), a COVID-19 PCR positive, BNP at 160 pg/mL (≤100), lactate at 1.2 mmol/L (0.5–2.2), and a negative urine drug screen. The chest X-ray showed no acute events. The transthoracic echocardiogram was normal with an EF of 60%. The patient was walked on treadmill and her junctional heart rhythm increased to 91 bpm; she was given 1 mg of atropine IV over a period of 5 min, in which her sinus rate increased to >100 bpm. Given the improvement in the patient’s symptoms, there was no indication for a dual chamber pacemaker. Hence, she was started on theophylline 200 mg oral dose daily with follow up within 1 week at the clinic (A,B). Upon her follow up, she had a heart rate of 90 bpm while on theophylline and no side effects were reported. Later, at her 5-week follow up visit, a complete resolution of her symptoms was reported and theophylline use was discontinued. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

She had no spontaneous movement, no response to painful stimuli, no pupillary reflex, and no corneal reflex. Doll's eye movement was absent. Her pupils were 1 mm in diameter and nonreactive to light. Deep tendon reflexes were absent.\nApproximately 1 hour after arrival she had a second generalized tonic clonic seizure with fever that lasted 10 seconds, and was treated with 0.3 mg/kg of intravenous diazepam. She had dark brown-colored hematemesis, so we performed L-tube irrigation with normal saline. A computed tomography (CT) scan indicated diffuse symmetric low density in the basal ganglia, thalami, and pons with brain swelling (). Because of brain swelling, unstable vital sign, and thrombocytopenia, we decided to defer lumbar puncture and after all we did not make it. She was admitted to the intensive care unit.\nHer platelet count was 32,000/µL, white blood cell was 6,240/µL, aspartate aminotransferase was 4,579 U/L, alanine aminotransferase was 2,787 U/L, ammonia was 38 mmol/L and C-reactive protein was 1.0 mg/dL. Coagulation testing for prothrombin, partial thromboplastin and thrombin times, fibrin degradation products, and D-dimer were elevated. Blood urea nitrogen was 30 mg/dL and serum creatinine was 1.3 mg/dL. Creatine kinase-MB, myoglobin, and troponin-T were elevated. Respiratory virus polymerase chain reactions for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, and rhinovirus were negative, but the test for parainfluenza virus was positive on a nasal wash specimen. Serological tests for hepatitis viruses, mycoplasma, herpes virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and salmonella were all negative.\nElectroencephalography indicated extremely low voltage and featureless background rhythms (). Brain MRI performed on the day of hospitalization indicated diffuse bilateral symmetric signal changes of both basal ganglia, thalami, periventricular white matter, pons, and cerebral white matter, as well as generalized swelling of the brain. The involved areas were diffusely hypointense on T1W images () and hyperintense on T2W images (). We diagnosed the patient with ANE based on the clinical symptoms and MRI findings.\nThe patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated because of shallow breathing and profound alteration of sensorium on the day of hospitalization and she was treated with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, acyclovir, intravenous immunoglobulin, and methylprednisolone. A chest X-ray was normal at admission, but indicated right perihilar infiltration on the 5th day of admission. Her consciousness had no interval change, and blood pressure, heart rate, and urine output decreased on day 13. The 14th day of admission, she died due to multiple organ failure.

    "question": "A 65-year-old African American female with past medical history significant for noninsulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus, essential hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic back pain, morbid obesity (body mass index (BMI) was 41), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), uterine fibroids, generalized anxiety disorder, and former tobacco abuse presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of generalized abdominal pain of 3 weeks' duration with intermittent diarrhea and constipation. Upon review of systems, she complained of atypical chest pain which was pleuritic and reproducible on palpation. The chest pain was nonexertional but she had exertional dyspnea. Of note, she had no prior history of cardiovascular disease.\nPast surgical history was remarkable for cesarean section and hysterectomy. Prior to admission medications included metformin, hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol, ranitidine, and acetaminophen. Family history was remarkable for diabetes. In terms of social history, she was a former tobacco smoker, drank alcohol socially, and denied illicit drug use. She had a history of allergy to hydroxyzine, propoxyphene, and zomepirac.\nIn the ED, measurement of vital signs showed a temperature of 37.0°C, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 148/82, and pulse oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Initial physical examination was normal except for obesity, depressed mood, chest wall tenderness, mild abdominal distention with tympanic note to percussion and mild generalized nonspecific tenderness to palpation. Rectal exam showed small nonbleeding external hemorrhoids. Complete blood count and basic metabolic panel were normal except for blood glucose of 240 milligrams/deciliter (mg/dL). Hemoglobin A1c was 9.3%. Troponin I was slightly elevated at 0.07 and it trended down on second measurement. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with new T-wave inversion in the inferolateral leads. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was only remarkable for fecal stasis in the rectum. Her abdominal pain and constipation was partially relieved after administration of IV morphine and senna-docusate.\nShe was also given aspirin for the chest pain. After her abdominal symptoms moderately improved, she was placed in the observation unit for cardiology consultation. After evaluation by the cardiologist, she was admitted to a telemetry unit for an inpatient cardiac stress test. She was receiving 81 mg aspirin daily. On day 2 of hospital admission, she underwent myocardial perfusion scan using the standard 0.4 mg regadenoson (LEXISCAN) injection. The stress test showed reversible perfusion defect involving the apex and lateral wall of the left ventricle, suggesting myocardial ischemia. At that time, clopidogrel (Plavix) was added to aspirin and the patient was started on IV heparin per ACS protocol pending cardiac catheterization. On day 4, coronary angiography was performed and it showed no significant occlusive coronary artery disease (CAD). During the catheterization procedure, the patient received IV heparin and IV nitroglycerin in addition to midazolam for sedation and fentanyl for analgesia. The radio contrast used was iohexol (OMNIPAQUE 350). Post-procedure, IV heparin was discontinued while DAPT with aspirin and Plavix were resumed.\nAfter recovery from sedation, the patient complained of a headache which got progressively worse within a few hours. It did not improve with repeated doses of oral hydrocodone and oral/IV acetaminophen. After around 12 hours of cardiac catheterization, the patient developed acute left-sided ptosis, deviated gaze (down and outward palsy), and anisocoria with left pupillary dilation (mydriasis) consistent with acute left 3rd nerve palsy (). The patient did not complain of decreased vision and visual field testing by confrontation was normal. She had no other sensory or motor deficits. Her mental status examination did not show evidence of confusion. Her vital signs were normal. STAT CT head without contrast (per stroke protocol) was read as negative for acute intracranial process. CTA of the head and neck was negative for arterial stenosis or aneurysms. The next day, MRI head and orbit with and without contrast were done using Gadodiamide as the MRI contrast agent. The MRI report, as read in our hospital, indicated a nonenhancing heterogeneous pituitary mass measuring 1.9 × 2.0 cm in the greatest dimension and slightly compressing on the optic chiasm suggestive of pituitary macroadenoma (). There was no report of any bleed/infarction by either CT or MRI report.\nA multidisciplinary team approach was undertaken with involvement of neurology, endocrinology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology (ENT), and neurosurgery. A full ophthalmological examination was normal except for complete left 3rd nerve palsy and mild cataracts. Visual field testing was normal. Hormonal studies were ordered and the results were as shown in . Of note, prolactin was lower than normal, while adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level was above the reference range. Both follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) were considered low given the patient's postmenopausal status. The patient had normal random cortisol and free T4 level. She did not receive any IV glucocorticoids. The next day after the third nerve palsy, the patient developed a mild fever at 37.9°C with mild neutrophilic leukocytosis (white blood cell count 14.2 K/UL). The patient was transferred to a neuro step-down unit for close observation. Her vital signs remained mostly normal. Subjectively, she neither had a progression of symptoms nor developed new symptoms. Her headache was controlled with oral hydrocodone/acetaminophen. Her full neurologic examination remained normal except for isolated complete left oculomotor palsy. Leukocytosis gradually normalized over several days.\nPituitary apoplexy was highly suspected as a cause of the third nerve palsy, but the diagnosis was challenged by the fact that our radiologist's interpretation of imaging did not mention bleed or cavernous sinus extension. The diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy of the third nerve from microvascular ischemia was contemplated but it was felt less likely because it is usually pupil-sparing []. Neurosurgery requested ENT help for trans-sphenoidal pituitary resection. ENT did not feel comfortable with the plan and recommended transfer to a higher level center. The patient and her family were involved in decision making. They were truthfully told that our medical center is not a high volume center for such pituitary cases and the patient might benefit from a transfer to a more experienced center. They chose to transfer and the patient was transferred by ambulance to an academic center of excellence on day 7 of presentation.\nThere, neuroradiologists read the images obtained at our hospital differently. The new CT scan report indicated increased attenuation of the sella turcica and in the suprasellar cistern at the site of the patient's pituitary mass, suggestive of possible hemorrhage within the tumor (). The new MRI report indicated that there was a sellar/suprasellar mass lesion which appeared to show central intrinsic T1 shortening and hypoenhancement with peripheral right-sided enhancement. There was mass effect on the optic chiasm superiorly. The lesion appeared to extend laterally into the left cavernous sinus with mild mass effect on the cavernous internal carotid artery. The overall hypoenhancing portion measured 2.1 × 1.9 × 1.3 cm (Figures and ).\nThe physicians in the other hospital decided to proceed with surgical intervention hoping to relieve the pressure on the third nerve. On day 9 of symptoms, the patient underwent successful trans-sphenoidal pituitary resection. Intraoperatively, the neurosurgeon reported a typical contused apoplectic adenoma. A frozen section biopsy report, as well as final pathology report, confirmed necrotic pituitary tumor with evidence of recent hemorrhage. The apoplectic adenoma was removed and the pituitary gland was left intact. Postoperatively, the laboratory assessment indicated central hypothyroidism and secondary adrenal insufficiency. Vital signs were stable. No major sodium abnormalities were noted. The patient was started on oral hydrocortisone and levothyroxine. Otherwise, the immediate postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged home on day 11 of symptoms development. One-month follow-up at the neurosurgeon's office was remarkable for persistence of oculomotor palsy. A six-month follow-up is scheduled. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 46-year-old Japanese man without a remarkable medical history visited our hospital with chief complaints of fever, fatigue, generalized edema, and abdominal distention. His fever started two weeks prior to admission. Abdominal distention and edema gradually worsened, and he gained 7 kg of weight within two weeks, despite low food intake owing to loss of appetite. He denied previous episodes of infectious diseases. At initial presentation, he appeared exhausted. His vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 37.8 °C; blood pressure, 160/93 mmHg; heart rate, 109 beats/min; respiratory rate, 22 breathes/min; and oxygen saturation, 90% with room air. On physical examination, generalized pitting edema was observed. His heart sounds were normal, but his lung sounds were weak at the lung base on both sides. Jaundice was not observed, but a distended abdomen and hepatomegaly were observed. Blood test results on the day of admission revealed an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count (14,600/μL), mild anemia (hemoglobin level, 11.1 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 11.1 × 104/μL), renal impairment (blood urea nitrogen level, 60.7 mg/dL and serum creatinine level, 2.94 mg/dL), an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level (14.25 mg/dL), an elevated ALP level (768 U/L), polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia (immunoglobulin G [IgG], 2461 mg/dL), and an elevated IgG4 level (235 mg/dL). Immunological screening test results for autoantibodies were negative, except for positive antinuclear antibody (× 40) and anti-SS-A antibody. Polymerase chain reaction for HHV-8 DNA in a serum sample was negative (Table ). Computed tomography (CT) performed on the day of admission revealed massive pleural effusions and ascites, generalized mild lymphadenopathy (< 1.5 cm in diameter), and hepatosplenomegaly (Fig. ). Echocardiography performed on day 2 revealed normal wall motions without any sign of valvular disease, but a collapsed inferior vena cava was observed (maximum diameter < 5 mm). 18F–fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) revealed no apparent FDG uptake, except for slight uptake in the para-aortic lymph nodes (Fig. ). Considering the positive anti-SS-A antibody finding, lip biopsy was performed on day 6, but the pathological findings did not meet the criteria for Sjögren syndrome (SjS). On ophthalmological examination, keratoconjunctivitis was not observed; however, bilateral optic edema was remarkable (Fig. ). Serum IL-6 and plasma VEGF levels were assessed in a blood sample obtained on day 9, and both were elevated (25.2 pg/mL and 224 pg/mL, respectively). Abdominal paracentesis was performed on the same day, and the levels of IL-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in ascites were remarkably high (3310 pg/mL and 335 pg/mL, respectively). Bone marrow examination was performed on day 9. Bone marrow aspiration was dry tap, and bone marrow biopsy revealed a mild increase in megakaryocytes and mild reticulin myelofibrosis on silver impregnation staining (Fig. ). Biopsy of a cervical lymph node was performed on day 10, and the pathological findings were compatible with a mixed-type MCD histology (Fig. ). We suspected TAFRO syndrome and methylprednisolone (mPSL) pulse therapy (500 mg/day for three consecutive days) was initiated on day 10 after lymph node biopsy, followed by intravenous PSL (40 mg/day) and oral CsA administration. The disease severity of TAFRO syndrome one day prior to treatment initiation was very severe (grade 5) []. After the initiation of immunosuppressive treatment, the patient became afebrile and the CRP level returned to the normal range within two weeks. However, the patient’s platelet count and serum creatinine level as well as his overall condition did not improve, even after the initiation of immunosuppressive treatment (Fig. ). A central venous catheter was inserted and total parenteral nutrition was started as he could not eat owing to loss of appetite and refusal of tubal feeding. Diuretics, including furosemide, potassium canrenoate, trichlormethiazide, and tolvaptan were administered during hospitalization; however, the amount of ascites did not decrease (Fig. ). Urinalysis performed on day 25 revealed mild proteinuria (0.34 g/day) with a fractional excretion of sodium of 5.1% and a fractional excretion of urea nitrogen (FEUN) of 20.7%. Because urinalysis was performed under diuretics use, considering FEUN level and intravascular hypovolemia on echography, intravenous fluid replacement was performed to correct the pre-renal factor responsible for renal impairment. However, the patient’s volume depletion and blood pressure did not respond well to intravenous fluid replacement. Abdominal paracentesis was again performed on day 40, and it revealed persistently high levels of IL-6 and VEGF (4320 pg/mL and 421 pg/mL, respectively). Although urine volume was initially preserved with diuretic administration, the patient became oliguric from day 47 and anuric from day 49. He was hemodynamically unstable on day 50 (body temperature, 37.5 °C; blood pressure, 84/52 mmHg; heart rate, 109 beats/min; respiratory rate, 24 breaths/min; oxygen saturation, 95% with room air). As the patient was undergoing immunosuppressive therapy and his CRP levels increased by 10.08 mg/dL on the same day, systemic examination was performed to rule out the possibility of infectious disease. Analysis of ascites was performed on the same day, revealing purulent ascites, and Escherichia coli was isolated. E. coli was also isolated from blood cultures. CT of the chest showed a mass in the right lung (Fig. ) in addition to scattered appearance of high intensity regions in the myocardium, which were newly observed (Fig. ). Blood tests performed on day 50 revealed elevated β-d-glucan levels (23.0 pg/mL) and positive cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigenemia (41 cells/5 × 104 WBCs on the C7-HRP test). Aspergillus, Candida mannan, and Cryptococcus neoformans antigens were negative. We suspected bacterial peritonitis and fungal pneumonia. Intravenous meropenem, vancomycin, and caspofungin were initiated on the same day. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) using a polymethyl-methacrylate membrane was also initiated on the same day because anuria did not improve and the patient was hemodynamically unstable. Conditions of CRRT were as follows: mode, continuous hemodiafiltration; dialysis membrane, CH-1.8 W (Toray Medical Co., Ltd., Tokyo Japan); and anticoagulant, nafamostat mesilate. The blood, dialysate, substitute, and filtration flow rates were 100 mL/min, 400 mL/h, 400 mL/h, and 800 mL/h, respectively.\nHowever, approximately 10 h after CRRT initiation, cardiac arrest (ventricular fibrillation followed by pulseless electrical activity) suddenly occurred. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved by cardiopulmonary resuscitation with epinephrine injections. STEMI was suspected from electrocardiography findings obtained immediately after ROSC (Fig. ). Echocardiography performed immediately after ROSC revealed a generalized hypokinesis and akinesia of the anterior wall, septum, and apex without any apparent calcification of the cardiac wall. Blood tests performed after ROSC revealed a slightly elevated serum creatine kinase-MB level (80 U/L, normal range: < 25 U/L) and a remarkably elevated troponin I level (1.2904 ng/mL, normal range: < 0.0262 ng/mL), indicating the acute phase of MI. Emergent coronary angiography (CAG) was performed on the same day. On CAG, complete occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery was observed, and reperfusion was achieved through percutaneous old balloon angioplasty (Fig. ). An intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted to increase coronary blood flow and improve cardiogenic shock. However, even after successful coronary intervention, the patient was still hemodynamically unstable. Despite intensive care, the patient died on day 52.\nAutopsy was performed after obtaining consent from the patient’s relatives. The histological findings of autopsy are shown in Fig. . In this case, multiple infections, including bacterial peritonitis (small abscesses were observed in the abdominal space, and gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods were identified), systemic CMV infection (including the lungs, pancreas, and adrenal glands), and Trichosporon asahii infection in the lungs (T. asahii was isolated from sputum culture) were observed. Intravascular invasion of fungal hyphae was noted in the lungs. On histological evaluation of the heart, coagulation necrosis and neutrophil infiltration were observed, findings that were compatible with MI that occurred a few days before the autopsy. Considering that intravascular invasion of fungal hyphae was observed, embolization caused by fungal hyphae was a possible cause of MI in this case. Necrotic changes were observed in most internal organs. We considered multiple organ failure due to multiple severe infections and circulatory failure due to MI as the main causes of death in this patient. Although there was no stenotic lesion and vascular calcification was not apparent in the left anterior descending coronary artery, myocardial calcification was noted. Calcification in the skeletal muscle cells of the diaphragm and iliopsoas muscle without vascular calcification was also noted. The pathological findings of the kidney were compatible with thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and endothelial injury was noted, although fibrin thrombi were not observed in arterioles. IgA, IgG, and IgM were negative on immunofluorescence. Tubulointerstitial changes could not be evaluated because most of the tissue was necrotic due to changes after death and circulatory failure prior to death. In the bone marrow reevaluation, the number of megakaryocytes did not increase, and reticulin myelofibrosis was not remarkably changed. In the lymph node reevaluation, infiltration of plasma cells was decreased, and immunosuppressive therapy appeared partially effective, although the amount of ascites and IL-6 levels in ascites did not decrease in the present case. Fibrotic changes in the fat tissue of the anterior mediastinum were noted. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 27-year-old man presented to the emergency room with complaints of lightheadedness, dyspnoea, orthopnoea, and bilateral lower extremity oedema over the course of a few weeks. His symptoms were associated with chest discomfort and he denied similar past episodes. He had no significant past medical history. Family history was remarkable for a brother diagnosed with BTHS by genetic testing. The patient denied alcohol use and recreational drug use. He endorsed active cigarette smoking (0.33 packs per day). On presentation, the patient was afebrile with a temperature of 36.7°C, hypotensive to 86/54 mmHg, tachycardic to 104 beats per minute (b.p.m.), breathing at a rate of 18 breaths per minute, with an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. Physical examination was remarkable for diminished breath sounds at the lung bases bilaterally, tachycardia with regular rhythm, jugular venous distension to the earlobe, and 2+ pitting oedema in the lower extremities bilaterally. Complete blood count revealed leukopenia (2.9 k/μL; reference range: 4.0–10.8 k/μL), neutropenia (27.7%; reference range: 43.0–75.0%), and monocytosis (37.1%; reference range: 3.0–12.0%). Lipid panel showed total cholesterol of 91 mg/dL (reference range: 120–200 mg/dL), with a calculated LDL of 44 mg/dL (reference range: 0–99 mg/dL), and an HDL of 22 mg/dL (reference range: 40–59 mg/dL). Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with a ventricular rate of 128 b.p.m., criteria for left atrial enlargement, and a prolonged QTc interval of 589 ms (). The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation, diagnostic interventions, and treatment. Echocardiographic exam revealed enlargement of all four chambers ( and Video 1), with significant dilatation of the left ventricle (end-diastolic diameter 6.0 cm, end-systolic diameter 5.8 cm) and severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15–20%. Additionally, mild pulmonary hypertension was present. Ischaemic workup with coronary angiography revealed patent vessels ( and Video 2), and ventriculogram showed an LVEF of 20%. Right heart catheterization was remarkable for pulmonary arterial pressure of 26/11 mmHg (mean of 16 mmHg), a calculated Fick cardiac output of 3.18 L/min (normal range: 4–8 L/min) and a cardiac index of 2.02 L/min/m2 (normal range 2.5–4 L/min/m2). HIV testing was negative, ethanol level was within normal limits, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was mildly elevated at 5.12 μIU/mL (reference range: 0.4–4.0 μIU/mL), with free T4 within normal limits at 1.16 ng/dL. Based on the history of present illness, family history, physical examination findings, laboratory investigations, and diagnostic imaging results, the patient could likely have a diagnosis of BTHS. He was carefully diuresed to euvolemia, discharged in stable condition with a LifeVest wearable defibrillator for 3 months, and furosemide 20 mg per orum (PO) daily. He was also started on guideline-directed medical therapy including carvedilol 3.125 mg PO twice a day and sacubitril-valsartan 24–26 mg PO twice a day. At a 6-month follow-up visit, the patient had no further complaints, remained compliant with his discharge medications, and spironolactone 12.5 mg PO daily was added. An outpatient cardiac magnetic resonance imaging study with and without contrast for evaluation of infiltrative disease and other causes of non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy was non-suggestive of myocardial infarction, infiltrates, or other abnormal enhancement by late gadolinium enhancement imaging. The patient’s diagnosis was confirmed with outpatient genetic testing for TAZ gene mutation, and he continued to regularly follow-up with an advanced heart failure cardiologist. A repeat echocardiogram (Video 3) 2 years after the initial hospitalization showed evidence of cardiac remodelling with improvement in left ventricular size (end-diastolic diameter 5.02 cm, end-systolic diameter 4.06 cm) and LVEF (45–50%).

    "question": "An 88-year-old woman with a history of dementia, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, hypertension, and chronic cholelithiasis presented with nausea and non-bloody emesis for two days. No abdominal pain, fever, chills, dysuria, hematuria, melena, or hematochezia were exhibited.\nShe was hospitalized three years prior for a similar presentation. At that time, a CT scan was obtained which showed a large stone within the gallbladder (Figure ). During that presentation, the patient refused any surgical intervention and was treated conservatively. One year later, the patient returned with a similar presentation in which a second CT was obtained (Figure ) which showed a gall stone, as well as inflammatory changes and possible duodenal stricture. Thereafter, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and showed duodenopathy with a post-bulbar duodenal stricture. It was thought that the cholelithiasis may have caused inflammatory changes of the duodenum and led to the stricture formation. Pathological examination failed to demonstrate malignancy or Helicobacter pylori infection. She was treated conservatively per her request to avoid surgical intervention.\nExamination on this admission revealed a core temperature of 98.6, a heart rate of 78, a respiratory rate of 16, and an elevated blood pressure of 171/89. The patient had a normal mental status, respiratory, and cardiovascular examination. Abdominal examination was significant for moderate abdominal distention but otherwise unremarkable. Murphy’s sign was negative. There was no guarding or rigidity, no hernia was observed, and no masses or enlarged liver or spleen were palpated. Laboratory investigations were remarkable for an alkaline phosphatase of 283 unit/L (normal: 25 - 100), serum glucose of 171 mg/dl, and leukocytosis of 16.7 with a left shift. In addition, the renal panel was abnormal with a blood urea nitrogen of 33 and creatinine of 6.3. Other hepatic, hematologic, and metabolic studies were unremarkable.\nAn abdominal roentgenogram showed an abnormal gas pattern with distended gastric outline and gastrectasis which was increased compared to her prior studies obtained two years ago. A moderate stool burden was noted throughout the inferior colon and rectum representing fecal impaction. No free air or significant calcification were noted. An abdominal CT scan (Figure ) showed a large 4 cm gallstone in the duodenal bulb with interval development of air within the biliary tree and common duct. A nasogastric tube was placed and drained > 1 liter of dark, red-tinged fluid. Endoscopic studies revealed a normal esophagus, gastric antrum, and pylorus. Debris and fluid were found in the stomach and were suctioned using a gastroscope. A normal duodenal bulb with a large gallstone (4 - 5 cm) at the apex into the duodenal sweep was found. This was surrounded by mucosal edema. Because of the stone angulation, it was difficult to obtain purchase on the stone. Different devices were used in attempts to free the stone from the duodenum and manipulating it into the stomach. Efforts failed due to the calcified nature of the stone, the angulation of the duodenum, extensive inflammatory changes surrounding the stone, and the size of the stone. Subsequently, surgical management was discussed with the patient and her family who agreed to proceed with the operation.\nDiagnostic laparoscopy was attempted but failed due to the difficulty accessing the area of interest laparoscopically. Thus, an exploratory laparotomy was carried out. A midline incision was made and dissection was carried down until the duodenum was once again palpated. Attempts were made trying to move the stone proximally into the stomach; however, there was significant inflammation, as well as adhesions, in the duodenum from the longstanding cholecystitis and cholecystoduodenal fistula. Multiple attempts were made to try to lyse the adhesions, trying to free the angle into the stomach or make it less acute. Despite lysing all the adhesions and performing a limited Kocher maneuver, the attempts to move the stone into the stomach were unsuccessful. The surgical team then attempted to pass the stone more distally in an attempt to take it out through a jejunal enterotomy. The stoned moved freely down to D3/D4, but unfortunately, we were unable to move the stone beyond the ligament of Treitz. The ligament of Treitz was taken down, along with adhesions in the area; however, we were still unable to remove the stone. As there was some hematoma forming in this area, we elected to then proceed with a duodenotomy to retrieve the stone. The stone was moved back to D2, and electrocautery was used to make a 5 cm duodenotomy on the lateral antimesenteric border of the duodenum. The stone was encountered, freed, and extracted from the duodenum (Figure ). Repair of the duodenum and omental flap creation were performed. This was followed by placement of a gastrojejunostomy feeding tube. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 62-year-old female patient underwent a laparoscopic anterior resection procedure for sigmoid colon cancer. The patient who was discharged on postoperative day four uneventfully presented with complaints of abdominal pain, distended abdomen, nausea, and fever lasting for 24 hours on 4th day after discharge. Her past medical and surgical history was unremarkable except for a previous diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus for which she received prednisolone 16 mg/day as treatment.\nOn physical examination, she had fever at 38.7 C, blood pressure was 110/60 mm/Hg, heart rate was 100/min, and the respiratory rate was 18/min. She was in mild/acute distress and she was alert and oriented. Abdominal examination was notable for distention, hypoactive bowel sounds, and tenderness in all quadrants. There was guarding and rebound in the lower quadrants of the abdomen.\nLaboratory evaluation was remarkable for leukocytosis 18,000/mm3 (4500–10,000/mm3), and highly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels of 372 mg/dL (normal range < 5 mg/dL). All other laboratory parameters including electrolytes and renal and liver function tests were within the normal range. A computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed extravasation of luminal contrast from the anastomosis level into the pelvic region (). In addition, a collection of fluid measuring 8 × 5 cm was noticed in the pelvis. There was associated free air in the peritoneum.\nA diagnosis of peritonitis due to anastomosis leakage was made and urgent surgical intervention was recommended. The laparoscopic approach was planned. The abdomen was entered laparoscopically via the previous trocar sites. On laparoscopic exploration, the anastomosis site was characterized with small bowel adhesions covered with layers of fibrin clots and purulent fluid accumulation in the pelvic region. Aspiration of the purulent fluid was performed followed by separation of the small bowel adhesions. A 1 cm colon peritoneal fistula covered with fibrin layers was identified at the anastomosis site, which localized intraperitoneally. There was no fecal contamination. The abdomen was irrigated with isotonic saline solution and a complete decontamination of the pelvic contents was performed. After adequate drainage of pelvic collection, a drain was placed through the port site at the left lower quadrant across the anastomosis site into the pelvic region and the procedure was ended. The need for an ostomy was precluded as an endoscopic stent was planned for the closure of the anastomosis site. However, because our endoscopy unit had not been work at night time as emergency services, the patient was sent to the endoscopy unit on 5th hour after the operation.\nAt sigmoidoscopy, the anastomosis site with 1 cm fistula was identified at 17 cm above the anal verge (). To close the fistula, a 12 cm long partially coated SEMS (Hanarostent Duodenum/Pylorus Lasso, NCN, MI Tech Co., Seoul, South Korea) was placed across the site of leak successfully (). The patient was placed on prophylactic treatment with a third generation cephalosporin and intravenous metronidazole. A dramatic decrease in the patients fever and leukocytosis was observed 24 hours after the procedure. Abdominal pain gradually resolved and oral feeding was started. Abdominal drainage which started at a rate of 150–200 cc/day ceased after 5 days. Follow-up CT demonstrated complete resolution of the anastomosis leak and abscess. The drain was removed and stent removal was planned at four weeks after the procedures. On the seventh postoperative day, the patient was discharged uneventfully. Twenty-four days after the procedure, the patient presented again. She reported an incident of the stent falling out and passing in bowel motion. Sigmoidoscopy was performed and it was consistent with a complete healing of the anastomosis site, while the absence of the stent in the previously inserted location was confirmed (). During follow-up, the patients remained well with no complaints with defecation. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 74-year-old male with a history of mild cognitive impairment presented to the emergency department with failure to thrive and generalized weakness of three weeks duration. He was having difficulty swallowing which he related to a poorly fitted denture. He had thirty pounds of unintentional weight loss in the last three months due to loss of appetite. His past medical history was significant for diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, major depressive disorder, chronic pain syndrome, and hepatitis C. His social history was significant for 12.5 pack-year smoking and drinking (two to three glasses of wine/day). He denied any utilization of recreational drugs. In the emergency department, his vital signs were, BP-104/59 mmHg, HR-97 bpm, respiratory rate-14/minute, temperature-97.4 °F, and oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. He weighed 40 kg, and his BMI was 13.84 kg/m2. On physical examination, he was alert, oriented, and appeared weak and malnourished. The ill-fitted complete maxillary denture was removed. The oral cavity examination revealed a large (3 × 2 cm2) defect with an erythematous border that encompassed the mid-palatal structures and emanated from the hard palate into his nasal cavity (Figure ).\nThere was no discrete mass or ulcer and mucosa surrounding this defect appeared normal. On palpation, the lesion was non-tender without any palpable lymph node on the head and neck examination. His lungs, heart, neurological, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Laboratory data at admission showed Hb-11.7 g/dl, WBC’s-9.6 K/CMM, and platelets-190 K/CMM. The chemistry panel (BMP) was within the normal range. AST-23 U/L, ALT-25 U/L, and serum alkaline phosphatase were 114 U/L. Auto-immune work-up including anti-dsDNA, anti-proteinase-3 antibodies, myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibodies were negative. The patient was managed conservatively, with nutritional supplementation and supportive care. Contrast-enhanced CT of the neck demonstrates enlarged level 2A lymph nodes bilaterally (Figure and 2B), corresponding to increased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity on PET CT (Figure ).\nA biopsy of the palatal lesion was performed, which showed SCC (well-differentiated), with parakeratosis, acute, and chronic inflammation (Figure ).\nImmunohistochemistry by p16 shows diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic staining of well-differentiated SCC (Figure ). PD-L1 test showed a combined positive score of 10-15. CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis were negative for metastasis. NM bone scan showed radiotracer uptake in paranasal sinuses/facial bones. PET scan showed diffuse FDG activity in the hard palate, mildly hypermetabolic cervical, pretracheal, subcarinal, and left hilar nodes with minimal FDG activity. A diagnosis of locally advanced (stage IVa) oral cavity SCC was made. The patient was evaluated by a multidisciplinary team including an oncologist, head and neck surgeon, maxillofacial surgeon, radiation oncologist, and nutritionist for further management. The patient underwent prosthetic rehabilitation. A palatal obturator (prosthesis) was placed to improve his speech, eating, and prevent regurgitation. The patient opted for palliative care and did not want to pursue further treatment. He was discharged home. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 77-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with intractable nausea and bilious and non-bloody vomiting of one-day duration. This was associated with diffuse abdominal pain which he described as dull, non-radiating, and moderate in severity. His symptoms were exacerbated by oral intake. Prior to his presentation, he had normal bowel movements. He denied chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, dysphagia, diarrhea, or constipation. Past medical and surgical histories were noncontributory. The patient previously smoked 1.5 packs per day for 20 years but quit 31 years ago. He reported moderate alcohol use and denied illicit drug use.\nThree weeks prior to his presentation to the emergency department, he was diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic adenocarcinoma. He did not receive chemotherapy and elected for conservative management as well as palliative care. One day prior to his presentation, he underwent EUS-guided CPN for palliation of his debilitating pain. The procedure involved injecting bupivacaine and 98% absolute alcohol under general anesthesia to induce unilateral celiac plexus neurolysis. There were no immediate post-procedure complications, and the patient was discharged home in a stable condition soon after completion of the neurolysis. Of note, the patient was using oxycodone 5 mg oral tablets three times per day as needed for pain since his cancer diagnosis. In the last three weeks prior to the procedure, he did not complain of nausea or constipation. He also denied taking the medication more frequently than usual.\nIn the emergency department, vital signs demonstrated blood pressure of 115/73 mmHg, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37.2℃. Abdominal exam was significant for minimal epigastric tenderness without guarding or rebound tenderness. The remainder of the physical exam was noncontributory. Complete blood count (CBC) showed white blood cell (WBC) of 10.0 × 103/µL, hemoglobin of 12.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 295 × 103/µL. Basic metabolic panel (BMP) showed sodium of 135 mmol/L, potassium of 5.1 mmol/L, chloride of 96 mmol/L, creatinine of 1.34 mg/dL, glucose of 384 mg/dL, and anion gap of 9 mmol/L. Liver function tests showed aspartate transaminase (AST) of 12 U/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) of 17 U/L, alkaline phosphatase of 74 U/L, and total bilirubin of 0.4 mg/dL. Lipase was within reference range at 5.0 U/L. Urinalysis did not reveal ketones. Hemoglobin A1c was unremarkable at 5.4% and glucose levels normalized without treatment, suggesting that the initial hyperglycemia was probably related to stress.\nThe patient initially received intravenous fluids and was placed on a bowel rest regimen. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed significant gastric distension, which was concerning for obstruction at the level of the duodenum (Figure ).\nNext, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed large amounts of fluids within the gastric fundus and body, which was also concerning for duodenal obstruction. The examined first and second parts of the duodenum were normal (Figure ).\nAs a result, upper gastrointestinal series with barium swallow was performed to look for an obstruction distal to the second part of the duodenum. Although it showed delayed gastric emptying of the contrast, contrast was seen in the third part of the duodenum and jejunum ruling out a complete obstruction in the duodenum (Figure ).\nFinally, a push enteroscopy was performed to visualize the entire duodenum. It showed angulation in the third part of the duodenum but no obstruction or mucosal abnormalities in the third or fourth parts of the duodenum (Figure ).\nAt that point, extensive gastrointestinal workup ruled out small bowel obstruction, and the diagnosis of ileus was made. The patient received ondansetron and polyethylene glycol as needed, and his diet was advanced slowly. His symptoms improved over the course of a few days, and he experienced a return of normal bowel activity. He eventually tolerated a regular diet and was discharged home in a stable condition.

    "question": "In December 2019, a right-handed 38-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with increasing right shoulder pain and raised inflammatory parameters. Her past medical history was remarkable for paraplegia due to poliomyelitis in childhood and a residual epilepsy due to the sequelae of a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Apart from these conditions, for which she was wheelchair-bound, this patient was in good general health with a previous non-pathologic and well-functioning right shoulder.\nOne month prior to her admission with shoulder pain, she was involved in a car accident as a result of a tonic-clonic seizure. Upon admission, she developed hypertension with associated proteinuria and was diagnosed with a 26-week gestation previously unknown pregnancy and pre-eclampsia. She was previously nulliparous. At day six of hospitalization, the patient presented a spontaneous placental abruption and underwent an emergency caesarean section with a simple post-operative evolution.\nPhysical exam of her right upper extremity revealed a swollen, warm and painful right shoulder on palpation and mobilization without neurovascular disorder. On general examination, she had moderate asthenia without disorientation. The vital signs were: Temperature of 37.2 °C, heart rate at 104 beats per minute, blood pressure of 148/95 mmHg, respiratory rate at 23 per minute and an oxygen saturation within the norm (SpO2 95% breathing ambient air).\nHemoglobin was 101 G/L, leukocytes 9.8 G/L, thrombocytes 305 G/L and C-reactive protein was increased to 271 mg/L. Blood cultures were sent for culture.\nSuspecting right shoulder septic arthritis without any degenerative sign on X-ray (Fig. ), she underwent open surgical debridement, synovectomy and 9 L saline solution lavage of the right shoulder by a delto-pectoral approach with subscapularis tenotomy. Abundant pus at arthrotomy was observed with the observation of a stage 3 equivalent according to Gächter’s classification [].\nAwaiting culture results, empirical antibiotic treatment with intravenous 2,2 g 3td amoxicilline and clavulanic acid was initiated.\nWhilst the blood cultures and intra-operative cultures remained sterile (Fig. ) without any crystals positivity on microscopic analysis, the clinical evolution was unfavorable with persistent pain, inflammation and purulent drainage. The patient required two additional surgical debridements and lavages on days 4 and day 7 after the first surgery. Both surgical interventions revealed persistent amounts of purulent and fibrous material despite the previous procedures and the empirical antibiotic treatment.\nThe 16S ribosomal RNA PCR performed on the purulent intra-operative liquid revealed U. urealyticum at 2.95 × 106 copies/ml (Fig. ), positive specific cultures inoculated a posteriori confirmed this finding (Fig. ).\nCervical smear showed no simultaneous U. urealyticum genital infection. Fresh placental tissue was not available for further testing, but there was no evident macroscopic chorio-amnionitis.\nUpon receiving the microbiological documentation, a bi-therapy of levofloxacin and azithromycine was initiated. Susceptibility testing showed an intermediate sensibility to ciprofloxacin and clarithromycin. The strain was susceptible to doxycycline. Following cessation of breastfeeding, we started treatment with doxycycline for 4 weeks according to the guidelines of our institution and on the basis of the low initial therapeutic response []. Early mobilization was started with our physiotherapist (Fig. ). She showed a favorable course with an excellent biological and functional outcome with a post-surgical DASH score of 5,8 at 3 months follow-up []. As a reminder, a DASH score of 0 represents no disability and a score of 100 represents severe disability after surgery. Concerning the father of the infant, no other specific considerations were taken related to this infection. The infant presented good clinical evolution.

    "question": "A 40-year-old man was hospitalized due to jaundice and lethargic fatigue that started 10 days prior to admission. The patient had complaints of weight loss and night sweats. Four months prior to this admission, he had visited to the Department of ENT at another hospital with the complaint of nasal stuffiness. At that time, the serologic testing for hepatitis B antigen and anti-HIV antibody were positive. He has been treated with zidovudine, lamivudine and efavirenz for two months until admission. He assumed that his AIDS was transmitted from heterosexual contact at abroad ten years ago. On admission, the blood pressure was 120/70 mmHg, the pulse rate 90/min, the respiratory rate 20/min and the body temperature was 36.6℃. He was icteric on the physical examination. The liver was tender and firm in consistency. It was palpated at a three-finger breadth below the right costal margin. His spleen and lymph nodes were not enlarged. The laboratory results were normal apart from an ESR of 120 mm/h; leukopenia 3,930/mm3 (neutrophils: 58.8%, lymphocytes: 31% and monocytes: 8.4%) and hemoglobin 9.4 g/dL. The liver function tests were abnormal: total bilirubin 8.9 mg/dL (direct bilirubin: 6.05 mg/dL), AST 171 IU/L, ALT 100 IU/L and LDH 1063 IU/L. The total number of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes was 290/mm3 and 568/mm3, respectively, and the ratio of CD4/CD8 was 0.51. Abdominal enhanced CT scanning revealed multifocal and variable sized homogenous hypodense masses in both hepatic lobes (). A liver biopsy showed a heavy infiltration composed mainly of large lymphoid cells (). Immunohistochemical staining revealed the atypical cells to be CD20 positive (), which established a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma according to the WHO classification. Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated normal cellularity with normal maturation of all three cell lines. There was no malignant cell infiltration. After the patient was diagnosed as having diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, he received VAD (vincristine 0.4 mg, adriamycin 9 mg/m2, dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1-4, and additional dexamethasone on days 9-12 and days 17-20). The patient seemed to show a little clinical improvement, but before starting the second chemotherapy, he developed signs of spinal cord compression (). Emergency radiation therapy was delivered to the spine lesion. CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, adriamycin 50 mg/m2 and vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 on day 1 and prednisone 100 mg/m2 on days 1-5) and laminectomy induced temporary improvement (). Alas, the paraplegia continued and his clinical condition progressively worsened. He passed away 103 days after starting the second round of chemotherapy from complications of pressure sores, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism.
