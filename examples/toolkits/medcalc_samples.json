        "Patient Note": "A 16-year-old female adolescent was referred to our hospital with severe hypertension (systolic pressure 178 mmHg), which was first detected 7 months prior to presentation during a routine annual physical examination. She complained of intermittent headache for about 1 year, and her previous blood pressure, measured 1 month prior to her detection of hypertension, had been normal. She showed mild hypokalemia (3.4 mmol/L) in a routine blood test, and an additional workup considering secondary hypertension was planned. Despite taking amlodipine (0.1 mg/kg twice a day), her blood pressure remained uncontrolled.\nUpon admission to our hospital, her systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 155 mmHg (>99th percentile) and 111 mmHg (>99th percentile) respectively. She was 162.8 cm tall (50th\u201375th percentile) and weighed 55 kg (50th\u201375th percentile). Physical examination including ophthalmological examination revealed no abnormality other than hypertension, and her family history was negative for hypertension or renal diseases. Laboratory examination revealed normal levels of hemoglobin (14.4 g/dL), serum creatinine (0.57 mg/dL), serum total cholesterol (144 mg/dL), and normal urinalysis. Serum sodium, potassium, chloride, and total carbon dioxide levels were 134 mmol/L, 3.4 mmol/L, 102 mmol/L, and 27 mmol/L, respectively. Plasma renin activity was 9.83 ng/mL/hr (normal, 0.5\u20133.3 ng/mL/hr), and serum aldosterone level was 77.3 ng/dL (normal, 4\u201348 ng/dL). Urinary levels of vanillylmandelic acid, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, metanephrine, and normetanephrine were normal, and plasma levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine were also normal. Chest radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography showed normal findings. Renal Doppler ultrasonography revealed an avascular bilobed cyst in the lower pole of the right kidney (). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) angiography showed bilaterally normal renal arteries and an eccentric soft tissue component at the peripheral aspect of the cystic lesion ().

        "Lower Limit": "133.99",

        "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.\nThe patient's gender is female, which means that the gender coefficient is 0.85.\nThe patient is 16 years old. \nThe concentration of creatinine is 0.57 mg/dL. \nThe formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.\nThe patient's height is 162.8 cm, which is 162.8 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.628 m. The patient's weight is 55.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 55.0 kg / (1.628 m * 1.628 m) = 20.752 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 20.8, indicating they are normal weight.\nBecause the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 54.918 kg.\n\nUsing the Cockcroft-Gault equation:\nCrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).\nPlugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 16) * 54.918 * 0.85) / (0.57 * 72) = 141.042 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 141.042 mL/min.",

On the radiographs of the pelvis anteroposterior and frog leg view (), there was a 35\u00d740\u00d720 mm sized bony fragment, 15 mm distance from the left ischial tuberosity. After the patient admitted to our hospital, he had an examination of computed tomography () and magnetic resonance imaging for rule out pathologic conditions. There was a bony fragment at left ischial tuberosity, which was mainly from conjoined origin of biceps femoris and semitendinosus tendons without any bone marrow edema (). Overall, he diagnosed as old avulsion fracture at ischial tuberosity. He determined to get conservative treatment on condition of a gradual alleviation of the symptom. During the admitted 2 months, he just got rest and high intensity laser therapy. Thanks to the improvement except discomfort on running, he discharged and returned to his military unit. What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)? Your answer should be in terms of kg/m\u00b2."

The pain in the abdomen was diffuse and more as discomfort, which started following a jerk while the patient was traveling in a bus. No prior history of diabetes, hypertension or renal disease was reported.\nInvestigations conducted in a local hospital had revealed numerous red blood corpuscles (RBCs) and white blood corpuscles (WBCs) in urine sediment and 4 + proteinuria. Ultrasound showed moderate ascites. Plain computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed hepatomegaly with ascites. Serum creatinine measured the following day was high (4.0 mg/dl); hence, an opinion from a nephrologist was sought.\nUpon examination, he was anxious and hemodynamically stable.

The patient reported his back pain began four days ago when he was at work and tried to lift a 100 lb instrument. The patient went to see a chiropractor, but there was no improvement with his back pain. He then started to experience left thigh and buttock pain along with the back pain for which he took eight ibuprofen tablets a day (1600 mg) for four days before presenting to the hospital. He denies taking ibuprofen for any other pain that he experienced in the past.\nWhile in the emergency room, the initial labs revealed creatinine of 32mg/dL, BUN of 175mg/dL, Na of 128 mEq/L, K of 4.5mmol/L, Cl of 90mEq/L, Co2 of 17.0mEq/L, anion gap of 21, Ca of 7.9mEq/L, and a total creatine kinase of 1315 micromoles/L. His liver function tests (LFTs) were also elevated - serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 104 units, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 281 units. His urinalysis showed 3+ blood and 2+ protein but 0-5 red blood cells. Left lower extremity Doppler ultrasound was negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). CT scan of the abdomen was unremarkable. There was fatty infiltration of the liver and thickening of the bladder wall, and diffuse soft tissue edema involving the left hip. The patient was given ondansetron hydrochloride (Zofran\u00ae Injection) 4 mg intravenously (IV) Q6H PRN for nausea, oxycodone hydrochloride (Roxicodone\u00ae) 5 mg PO Q4H PRN for pain, morphine sulfate 2 mg IV Q2H PRN for severe back pain, hydralazine hydrochloride (Apresoline\u00ae Injection) 10 mg IV Q4H PRN for hypertension, ceftriaxone sodium 1 gm/ (sodium chloride) 100 mls at 200 mls/hr IV Q24H at 1900 SCH for cystitis, and sodium bicarbonate 150 meq/ (dextrose) 1,150 mls at 150 mls/hr IV, Q7H40M SCH. Acute kidney injury and metabolic acidosis was the impression on evaluation in the ED.\nLater the patient was moved to the telemetry unit to be followed up with the hospitalist. The patient was monitored by an internist, and a nephrology consultation was requested. On the following day, during the nephrology consultation, the patient's laboratory values were as shown in Tables -. The patient's vitals are mentioned in Table . CT scan and renal ultrasound of the kidneys were ordered. CT scan of the abdomen was unremarkable. The nephrologist's recommendation was to continue the patient on the IV fluids with bicarbonate and avoid nephrotoxins. The nephrologist closely monitored the patient, and the plan was to place the patient on temporary dialysis if the kidney function doesn't show improvement.\nOn a subsequent day on follow up with the internist, the kidney function tests were not improving; upon discussion with the nephrologist, a temporary dialysis catheter order was placed. On the same day, an interventional radiologist placed a right internal jugular vein (IJV) temporary dialysis catheter, and the patient went for the first round of hemodialysis treatment, after which the creatinine level went down to 18 mg/dl. Urinalysis was positive for protein and red blood cells, and the labs of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 1315 micromoles/L pointed towards rhabdomyolysis. The next day during the nephrology consultation, it was recommended to go for the second round of hemodialysis. The patient's lab showed phosphorus of 11.60 mg/dL, leading to sevelamer 800 mg PO TID initiation. The patient underwent another four rounds of hemodialysis, and the kidney function tests showed a creatinine level of 11.92 mg/dL.\nThe patient subsequently went through hemodialysis for the seventh time, but his kidney function had not yet returned to the normal level. The nephrologist ordered a tunneled dialysis catheter to be placed on the patient to be able to receive outpatient dialysis once he is discharged, which was also placed by an interventional radiologist. His labs were checked again, and the results showed that his CPK, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia were resolving to normal, but the creatinine stayed stable at a high level of 10.6 mg/dL. Due to the lack of improvement in the kidney function tests towards normal range, the nephrologist ordered a renal biopsy. A day later, a kidney biopsy was done (Figure ), which showed acute interstitial nephritis with very minimal chronicity, and the patient was started on prednisone 60 mg once a day. Because of the lack of improvement on the kidney function test to normal levels, the patient was declared to have end-stage renal disease and was discharged with the outpatient dialysis treatment program and to follow up with the nephrologist.",

The left pinna was found to be sore and reddish but without vesicles, which is why chondritis was diagnosed and amoxicillin and clavulanic acid prescribed. One day later she awaked with a peripheral facial nerve palsy on the left side and hypoesthesia of the left upper lip. The weeks before onset she had a lot of stress with her studies at the university but there was no fever, no vaccination, or infection. A few days before onset of the palsy she recognised dysesthesias of the parietal skull on the left side. The night before onset of the palsy she was exposed against the ventilator of an air condition for more than an hour. She was regularly taking loratadine.\nClinical neurologic examination on admission revealed slight hypoesthesia of the left upper lip, moderate peripheral facial nerve palsy, and generally reduced tendon reflexes. The left pinna showed an erythematous rash but no vesicles. Hearing and taste were normal and there was no vertigo, double vision, skew deviation, nystagmus, headache, hyposmia, or ataxia []. Blood chemical investigations revealed slight leucopenia but normal C-reactive protein. Ophthalmologic examinations excluded a zoster of the eye. Immediately after admission, she was treated with dexamethasone (40 mg intramuscularly) during two days followed by dexamethasone orally during another six days. Additionally, she received 750 mg acyclovir three times a day intravenously during eight days. For continuous pain periauricularly she received mefenamic acid and paracetamol with success.\nAt followup three days later she reported some transient vesicles at the left pinna, no longer visible at the visit, lid closure had improved, and there was recovery from the pinna's rash but only marginal voluntary innervation of the frontalis and lower facial muscles. Audiometry was normal. Followup six days after onset of the palsy showed complete lid closure but unchanged innervation of the other facial muscles. She reported neuralgiform pain in the left ear which is why gabapentin was prescribed with success. Eleven days after onset of facial palsy lid closure on the left side was complete. There were slight innervation of the frontal branch and only slight innervation of the left mouth corner. Nerve conduction studies 12 days after onset showed almost equal compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude when recording from the orbicularis oculi muscle but >50% amplitude reduction on the left side when recording from the orbicularis oris muscle.

The left pinna was found to be sore and reddish but without vesicles, which is why chondritis was diagnosed and amoxicillin and clavulanic acid prescribed. One day later she awaked with a peripheral facial nerve palsy on the left side and hypoesthesia of the left upper lip. The weeks before onset she had a lot of stress with her studies at the university but there was no fever, no vaccination, or infection. A few days before onset of the palsy she recognised dysesthesias of the parietal skull on the left side. The night before onset of the palsy she was exposed against the ventilator of an air condition for more than an hour. She was regularly taking loratadine.\nClinical neurologic examination on admission revealed slight hypoesthesia of the left upper lip, moderate peripheral facial nerve palsy, and generally reduced tendon reflexes. The left pinna showed an erythematous rash but no vesicles. Hearing and taste were normal and there was no vertigo, double vision, skew deviation, nystagmus, headache, hyposmia, or ataxia []. Blood chemical investigations revealed slight leucopenia but normal C-reactive protein. Ophthalmologic examinations excluded a zoster of the eye. Immediately after admission, she was treated with dexamethasone (40 mg intramuscularly) during two days followed by dexamethasone orally during another six days. Additionally, she received 750 mg acyclovir three times a day intravenously during eight days. For continuous pain periauricularly she received mefenamic acid and paracetamol with success.\nAt followup three days later she reported some transient vesicles at the left pinna, no longer visible at the visit, lid closure had improved, and there was recovery from the pinna's rash but only marginal voluntary innervation of the frontalis and lower facial muscles. Audiometry was normal. Followup six days after onset of the palsy showed complete lid closure but unchanged innervation of the other facial muscles. She reported neuralgiform pain in the left ear which is why gabapentin was prescribed with success. Eleven days after onset of facial palsy lid closure on the left side was complete. There were slight innervation of the frontal branch and only slight innervation of the left mouth corner. Nerve conduction studies 12 days after onset showed almost equal compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude when recording from the orbicularis oculi muscle but >50% amplitude reduction on the left side when recording from the orbicularis oris muscle. Antibodies against the varicella zoster virus (VZV) were determined three times by means of an ELISA test. IgG antibodies against VZV were positive at all three determinations and IgM antibodies against VZV were negative at the first and positive at the second and third determination, which is why valacyclovir orally was given for seven days after discontinuation of acyclovir.

At the time of admission, her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 120/80 mm Hg; pulse rate, 70 beats per minute; respiration rate, 18 breaths per minute; and body temperature, 37.5\u2103. She appeared emaciated and acutely ill. Her body mass index was 18.1 (height, 151 cm; and weight, 41.3 kg). A physical examination revealed icteric sclera, a very thin abdominal cavity, and a longitudinal surgical scar at the midline. Tenderness was noted in the upper abdominal area, and normal bowel sounds were heard. There was no particular finding in the limb or neurological examinations. Laboratory analysis revealed a white blood cell count of 27,000 cells/mm3; hemoglobin level, 12.3 g/dL; platelet count, 277,000 cells/mm3; aspartate aminotransferase level, 108 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase level, 144 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase level, 476 IU/L; total protein level, 6.5 g/dL; albumin level, 3.7 g/dL; total bilirubin level, 14.1 mg/dL; direct bilirubin level, 9.2 mg/dL; amylase level, 592 U/L; lipase level, 825 U/L; blood urea nitrogen level, 5.0 mg/dL; and creatinine level, 0.5 mg/dL. These data were compatible with diagnoses of acute cholangitis and acute biliary pancreatitis. An abdominal computed tomography scan revealed a round calcifying lesion near the pancreas (), and the absence of the retroperitoneal duodenum and the anterior position of the spleen with respect to the left kidney. The anterior and left-sided position of the superior mesenteric vein compared with that of the superior mesenteric artery was observed in the abdominal computed tomography scan ().

Intestinal malrotation could be diagnosed based on these findings. ERCP was performed by using a lateral-view endoscope in the usual way. After approaching the ampulla, the endoscope was pushed against the duodenal wall to maintain the papilla in the correct position, and a selective bile duct cannulation confirmed the presence of a 12-mm round stone in the common bile duct. With a guidewire-assisted technique, the single dark brown stone was removed by using a Dormia basket after the endoscopic sphincterotomy (). The procedure lasted for 15 minutes. A cholangiogram obtained through an endoscopic nasobiliary drainage tube revealed a distorted biliary system, which was characterized with diffuse dilatation of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary trees, downward-positioned gallbladder and a right intrahepatic biliary tree, and a horizontally located common bile duct.

The patient was successfully treated with Topamax but continued to vomit >10 times/day. The patient was G2P2 with full-term normal delivery and a birth weight of 3.35 kg. The intellectual and physical development of the patient was similar to that of healthy children of the same age. There was no family history of genetic diseases, and the parents were in a non-consanguineous marriage.\nThe findings of the physical examination were as follows: BP, 85/55 mmHg; height, 92.7 cm; weight, 12 kg. The patient was mentally alert, and no significant anomalies were observed in the heart, lungs, abdomen, nervous system or external genitalia. A generalized hyperpigmentation was observed. Esophagography showed achalasia of the lower esophagus at the cardia. In the hospital, the patient was observed not to produce tears when crying. The results of a bilateral Schirmer test were 0 mm, which led to the diagnosis of alacrima. Further medical history confirmed that the alacrima had manifested at birth. Following the diagnosis of AS, the patient was treated with hydrocortisone replacement therapy (25 mg/m2), and the vomiting was alleviated. Genetic testing confirmed a c.1366C>T mutation in exon 15 of the AAAS gene (). No additional follow-up information is available for this patient. Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?"

We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 139.0 mEq. To convert from 139.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 139.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 139.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 139.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 139.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 139.0 mmol sodium/L. \nThe concentration of bun is 20.0 mg/dL. \nThe concentration of glucose is 599.0 mg/dL. \nPlugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 139.0 + (20.0 / 2.8) + (20.0 / 18) = 318.421 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 318.421 mmol/L.

        "Patient Note": "In the 1998 report on the treatment of B, he was 20 years old. B had been a child with a classical gender dysphoric development and fulfilled the current criteria for GnRH analog treatment eligibility. He was interviewed shortly after his legal gender change. This meant that he had had puberty suppression, cross-sex hormone treatment, a mastectomy, ovariectomy, and uterus extirpation. From his assessment during the diagnostic phase, he appeared to be an intelligent person (IQ = 128) with excellent problem-solving capabilities with respect to emotional matters. Vulnerable aspects of his psychological functioning were his insecurity about himself and moderately depressed feelings. In all other areas, his scores on a broad range of measures were in the average range, as compared to Dutch normative samples. Shame concerning his transsexualism made him highly selective in his friendships and guarded in his contacts with new people. At the assessment, 1 year after his ovariectomy but prior to his metaidoioplasty, he no longer reported feelings of gender dysphoria. He had adjusted easily to the male role and expressed no doubts on the adequacy of his masculine behavior. After the development of his secondary male sex characteristics, nobody had ever approached him as a woman. He never felt any regrets about his decision and had never contemplated living as a girl again. Knowing what gender reassignment implied, he would do it all over again. B was happy with his life and did not feel lonely. He showed a significant pre-post treatment decrease in his feelings of inadequacy. At the time, he was attending medical school.\nB attended the pediatric endocrinology clinic for the first time when he was age 13.7 years. His medical history was uneventful. Puberty had started 1\u20132 years previously, but menarche had not occurred. On physical examination, a healthy girl was seen with a height of 157.3 cm and a Tanner pubertal stage of B3, P3. Bone age according to Tanner and Whitehouse was 13.5 years. Target height, as a female, was estimated at 171 cm, based on the parental height. Puberty suppression was induced by the GnRH analog Triptorelin, in a dose of 3.75 mg every 4 weeks intramuscularly. On this dosage, B steadily kept on growing.\nAt age 18.6 years, his height was 165.8 cm. Induction of male puberty and accompanying secondary male sex characteristics was initiated by administration of 100 mg testosterone-ester mixture intramuscularly every 2 weeks. This was, after 6 months, increased to 250 mg testosterone-ester mixture, every 2\u20133 weeks intramuscularly. At the start of the androgen treatment, the Triptorelin treatment was discontinued.\nWhen B was 20 years old, he had a subcutaneous mastectomy by way of an infra-areolar approach, a few months later followed by a hysterectomy and gonadectomy. Two years later, metaidoioplasty and testes implantation were performed.\nFifteen years after the first interview and testing session, at age 35, B was seen again at the clinic. He lived on his own and he worked as a family doctor in private practice with two colleagues. All family members knew about his transitioning as did some of his friends. He was very satisfied about his circle of friends and had never been treated negatively because of his transsexualism.\nB was still satisfied about his (minor) breast surgery, his ovariectomy, and his hysterectomy, but no longer about the metaidoioplasty he underwent one year after the first follow-up session. He did not like its size and shape and he could hardly urinate in a standing position. He was able to have orgasms, but he could not have sexual intercourse. Because of his desire to have more convincingly male appearing external genitals and his wish to be able urinate in a standing position, he considered having a phalloplasty. Despite his good looks and very masculine appearance, he had not had many steady girlfriends, which may have resulted from the guardedness he already had as an adolescent. At age 29, he had a serious relationship with a woman, which lasted for 5 years. However, he chose not to live together when the opportunity to do so arose. After his choice to continue living apart, his girlfriend ended the relationship, a few months before his interview at the clinic. This made him very much regret his lack of commitment. B considered it likely that his need to distance himself from her had been related to his shame about his genital appearance and his feelings of inadequacy in sexual matters. Additional factors, such as serious illness of his father and a suicide among his sisters\u2019 in-laws, made him rather sad at the time of the interview. Although his psychoneuroticism score on the Symptom Checklist-90 (Arrindell & Ettema, ) was in the normal range, his depression subscore was high, indicating depressed feelings. However, on the Beck Depression Inventory, he scored in the \u201cminimal range\u201d (van der Does, ), indicating that he did not fulfill criteria for clinical depression. On the Adult Self-Report, assessing adaptive functioning and problems in adults aged 18-59 years (Achenbach & Rescorla, ), all his scores were in the normal range.\nIt seems, therefore, that B functioned well in most aspects of life, but that he was still struggling with the question, how to handle the dissatisfaction and shame about his genital appearance.\nAt age 35, on physical examination, we saw a healthy and well virilized person. Blood pressure was 120/85 mmHg, final height was 169.5 cm and weight was 73 kg, which resulted in a body mass index (BMI) of 25.4 kg/m2. Sitting height was 88 cm. Skull circumference was 55.5 cm. For a comparison of his anthropometrical measurements to the normal reference values of Dutch males and females, see Table .\nA fasting venous blood sample was drawn. General health markers, like hematological parameters (Hb, ht, erythrocytes), renal function, and liver enzymes, were all within the normal reference value ranges. His lipid profile showed a total cholesterol level of 228.3 mg/dl (<251.5 mg/dl), LDL-cholesterol 154.8 mg/dl (<193.5 mg/dl), HDL-cholesterol 55.0 mg/dl (>34.8 mg/dl), and triglycerides 97.4 mg/dl (<177 mg/dl). His glucose value was 97.3 mg/dl (<144.1 mmol/l) with an insulin level of 21 pmol/l (12\u201396 pmol/l for a fasting sample). His HbA1c was 5.4% (4.3\u20136.1%). These values were in the normal range.\nWith respect to the gonadal axis, a normal-low serum testosterone level of 236.6 ng/dl (231\u2013866 ng/dl) was found. This relatively low level was probably due to the fact that the blood sample was taken just before the next testosterone-ester mixture injection. Gonadotropins were elevated as a consequence of the gonadectomy. LH and FSH were 16 U/l and 50 U/l, respectively. Additionally determined endocrine parameters, such as thyroid and adrenal function, were all within normal reference ranges.\nWith respect to bone mineral density (BMD), a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan was performed to determine B\u2019s BMD in the lumbar spine, the non-dominant hip, and (further) total body. The observed values were related to the bone peak mass for white females and for white males, resulting in T-scores. For all values, the z-score was determined as well (see Table ).",

The observed values were related to the bone peak mass for white females and for white males, resulting in T-scores. For all values, the z-score was determined as well (see Table ).

The urinalysis showed the following: pH 7.5, density 1010, protein (++), erythrocytes (+++), leucocytes (-) and dysmorphic erythrocytes in the urinary sediment.\nBased on these biochemical and urinary abnormalities, the patient was diagnosed as HUS. After seven plasma exchange sessions, the hemolysis finally stopped and the laboratory abnormalities and renal function reverted to normal. The respiratory infection was treated with appropriate antibiotic regimens.\nIn the hormonal evaluation, free thyroxine (fT4) was 1.11 ng/dL (0.8-2.2), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 3.028 mU/mL (0.6-5.5), anti-peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibody 62 IU/ mL (<20), anti-thyroglobulin (anti-TG) antibody 65 IU/mL (<4.0), cortisol 25.5 mg/dL (3-21), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) 28.1 pg/mL (10-60), estradiol 14 ng/dL (0.2.0), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) 0.32 mIU/mL, luteinizing hormone (LH) 0.07 mIU/mL (0.02-0.3), anti-pancreatic islets antibody 1/100 (<1/10), parathyroid hormone (PTH) 65.9 ng/mL (10-65), renin 72 ng/L (5-35), aldosterone 248 pg/mL (20-300), vitamin B12 456 pg/mL (150-883) and folic acid 4.2 ng/mL (3.1-20.5) before plasma exchange therapy.

        "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 134.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 134.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 134.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 134.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 134.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 134.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 109.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 109.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 109.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 109.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 109.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 109.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 21.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 21.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 21.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 21.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 21.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 21.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (109.0 mEq/L + 21.0 mEq/L) = 4.0 mEq/L.

        "Patient Note": "An 18-year-old Black female who had been diagnosed with SCD in childhood, subsequently suffering frequent pain crises and undergoing repeated transfusions, presented to the emergency room with a 21-day history of progressive lower limb oedema accompanied by dyspnoea and orthopnoea. In addition, she reported a 3-day history of severe chest pain, together with a productive cough and fever as high as 38 \u00b0C. She reported no reduction in urine volume and no recent history of skin infection or tonsillitis. On physical examination, she was found to be very pallid and normotensive (blood pressure, 130/80 mmHg), with a heart rate of 104 bpm, a respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air, as well as being found to have developed anasarca. One month prior, she had undergone outpatient laboratory tests, which had shown that her renal function was normal\u2014with a serum creatinine concentration of 0.75 mg/dl and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), as determined by the Chronic Kidney Disease\u2013Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD\u2013EPI) equation, of 134.9 ml/min/1.73 m2\u2014urine analysis showing no haematuria or proteinuria.\nBlood tests performed at admission to the emergency room revealed the following: haemoglobin, 6.1 g/dl; haematocrit, 18.8%; haptoglobin, < 10 mg/dl; reticulocyte fraction, 6.11%; no schistocytes; lactate dehydrogenase, 433 U/L; indirect bilirubin, 0.36 mg/dl; leucocyte count, 18,820 cells/mm3; neutrophil count, 13,630 cells/mm3; lymphocyte count, 2790 cells/mm3; platelet count, 622;000 cells/mm3; and urea, 29 mg/dl. The patient showed signs of hyperfiltration, including a serum creatinine concentration of 0.49 mg/dl and a CKD\u2013EPI-determined eGFR of 148.5 ml/min/1.73 m2, although no hydroelectrolytic or acid-base disorders were identified. A urine sample was found to contain 100 leucocytes/field and 70 erythrocytes/field. In addition, 24-h proteinuria was 8.99 g. Further analysis of the blood samples showed the following: total proteins, 3.9 g/dl; albumin, 1.2 g/dl; globulins, 2.7 g/dl; total cholesterol, 210 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein, 114 mg/dl; high-density lipoprotein, 37 mg/dl; triglycerides, 205 mg/dl; C4, 26.1 mg/dl (normal range, 10\u201338 mg/dl); C3, 62 mg/dl (normal range, 73\u2013149 mg/dl); C-reactive protein, 24.9 mg/dl (normal range, < 5 mg/dl). The serology was negative for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. The patient also tested negative for antinuclear factor, anti-DNA, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Serum protein electrophoresis showed hypoalbuminaemia and an anti-streptolysin O level of 816 IU/ml (normal range, < 200 IU/ml). Blood and urine cultures were negative. A chest X-ray showed mild congestion and infiltrate in the right lung base. Ultrasound of the kidneys and urinary tract showed that the kidneys were normal in size and appearance.\nGiven the clinical presentation, the diagnostic hypothesis was pneumonia and anasarca due to nephritic-nephrotic syndrome. The patient was started on ceftriaxone (1 g, twice daily). Computed tomography angiography of the chest ruled out pulmonary thromboembolism and acute chest syndrome, thus indirectly confirming the diagnosis of pneumonia.\nAfter the infection had been controlled, the patient underwent renal biopsy. Light microscopy revealed 7 glomeruli with global endocapillary proliferation; neutrophil and macrophage infiltrate (Fig. a); synechiae in 10% of the glomeruli; occasional splitting of the glomerular basement membrane; and a preserved Bowman\u2019s capsule. The tubules were dilated, with foci of epithelial regeneration and neutrophils within their lumina. There was focal oedema in the interstitium.

        "Usr Msg": "An 18-year-old Black female who had been diagnosed with SCD in childhood, subsequently suffering frequent pain crises and undergoing repeated transfusions, presented to the emergency room with a 21-day history of progressive lower limb oedema accompanied by dyspnoea and orthopnoea. In addition, she reported a 3-day history of severe chest pain, together with a productive cough and fever as high as 38 \u00b0C. She reported no reduction in urine volume and no recent history of skin infection or tonsillitis. On physical examination, she was found to be very pallid and normotensive (blood pressure, 130/80 mmHg), with a heart rate of 104 bpm, a respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air, as well as being found to have developed anasarca. One month prior, she had undergone outpatient laboratory tests, which had shown that her renal function was normal\u2014with a serum creatinine concentration of 0.75 mg/dl and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), as determined by the Chronic Kidney Disease\u2013Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD\u2013EPI) equation, of 134.9 ml/min/1.73 m2\u2014urine analysis showing no haematuria or proteinuria.\nBlood tests performed at admission to the emergency room revealed the following: haemoglobin, 6.1 g/dl; haematocrit, 18.8%; haptoglobin, < 10 mg/dl; reticulocyte fraction, 6.11%; no schistocytes; lactate dehydrogenase, 433 U/L; indirect bilirubin, 0.36 mg/dl; leucocyte count, 18,820 cells/mm3; neutrophil count, 13,630 cells/mm3; lymphocyte count, 2790 cells/mm3; platelet count, 622;000 cells/mm3; and urea, 29 mg/dl. The patient showed signs of hyperfiltration, including a serum creatinine concentration of 0.49 mg/dl and a CKD\u2013EPI-determined eGFR of 148.5 ml/min/1.73 m2, although no hydroelectrolytic or acid-base disorders were identified. A urine sample was found to contain 100 leucocytes/field and 70 erythrocytes/field. In addition, 24-h proteinuria was 8.99 g. Further analysis of the blood samples showed the following: total proteins, 3.9 g/dl; albumin, 1.2 g/dl; globulins, 2.7 g/dl; total cholesterol, 210 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein, 114 mg/dl; high-density lipoprotein, 37 mg/dl; triglycerides, 205 mg/dl; C4, 26.1 mg/dl (normal range, 10\u201338 mg/dl); C3, 62 mg/dl (normal range, 73\u2013149 mg/dl); C-reactive protein, 24.9 mg/dl (normal range, < 5 mg/dl). The serology was negative for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. The patient also tested negative for antinuclear factor, anti-DNA, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Serum protein electrophoresis showed hypoalbuminaemia and an anti-streptolysin O level of 816 IU/ml (normal range, < 200 IU/ml). Blood and urine cultures were negative. A chest X-ray showed mild congestion and infiltrate in the right lung base. Ultrasound of the kidneys and urinary tract showed that the kidneys were normal in size and appearance.\nGiven the clinical presentation, the diagnostic hypothesis was pneumonia and anasarca due to nephritic-nephrotic syndrome. The patient was started on ceftriaxone (1 g, twice daily). Computed tomography angiography of the chest ruled out pulmonary thromboembolism and acute chest syndrome, thus indirectly confirming the diagnosis of pneumonia.\nAfter the infection had been controlled, the patient underwent renal biopsy. Light microscopy revealed 7 glomeruli with global endocapillary proliferation; neutrophil and macrophage infiltrate (Fig. a); synechiae in 10% of the glomeruli; occasional splitting of the glomerular basement membrane; and a preserved Bowman\u2019s capsule. The tubules were dilated, with foci of epithelial regeneration and neutrophils within their lumina. There was focal oedema in the interstitium. The interlobular arteries had a normal aspect, with intimal proliferation in the arterioles. Immunofluorescence performed on frozen sections showed intensity of deposition of C3 (2+/3+), IgG (1+/3+), IgA (1+/3+) and lambda light chains (1+/3+), with a granular pattern, distributed diffusely throughout the capillary loop.

        "Patient Note": "A 37-year-old young female patient presented with progressive dyspnea, hypoxia, and left lung consolidation. She had presented to our emergency department, with a 3-day history of shortness of breath, fever, and nonproductive cough. Her past medical history included recently diagnosed and untreated Hepatitis C, related to prolonged intravenous heroin abuse. She was on methadone de-addiction program but was continuing to occasionally using heroin, the last time a week prior to admission. She was also an active smoker, with a 20 pack-year history.\nOn clinical examination she appeared malnourished and dehydrated, with multiple skin tattoos and burn marks on the left forearm. Temperature was 38.2\u00b0C, respiratory rate 30/Min, blood pressure 90/50 mmHg, pulse rate 120 beats/min, oxygen saturation was 95% on room air. Heart sounds were dual, with no added sounds or murmurs. There were no crackles or wheezes audible on auscultation but air entry was markedly reduced on the left side. Routine laboratory investigations showed a hemoglobin of 99 g/L. white cell count 23.7 \u00d7 109/L with a neutrophil count of 22.75 \u00d7 109/L, and lymphocytes of 0.79 \u00d7 109/L, CRP 206 mg/L, Alanine transaminase (ALT) 26 U/L, Aspartate transaminase (AST) 18 U/L, urea 3.5 mmol/L, creatinine 42 \u03bcmol/L. Chest X-ray (CXR) showed complete left-sided consolidation with no mediastinal shift [Figures and ]. Venous access was obtained via central cannulation of the internal jugular vein and she was resuscitated with 2 L of normal saline, started on ticaricillin/caluvulanate 3.1 g 6 hourly and referred to intensive care unit for admission with a presumptive diagnosis of severe community-acquired pneumonia.\nDespite adequate fluid resuscitation, the patient remained hypotensive with decreasing urine output, and noradrenalin infusion was initiated to improve blood pressure. She was intubated for worsening tachypnea and fatigue. Prior to intubation, chest computed tomography (CT) was performed, which confirmed consolidation of both the lobes on the left side; interestingly, no foreign body was described on the initial CT report, but detected on review after bronchoscopy [Figures and ]. Serology was drawn to assess for Hepatitis, HIV, and atypical infection. The antibiotic regime was augmented with the addition of vancomycin and azythromycin.\nIn view of the history of intravenous drug abuse a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, which demonstrated mild tricuspid regurgitation, no vegetations, and normal cardiac function. The patient was ventilated on synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation volume control mode, with a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg, Peak end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 and FiO2 of 0.5. There was only a minimal endotracheal aspirate and a repeat CXR showed the persistence of the left lobe consolidation with no improvement inspite of mechanical ventiltion. Flexible bronchoscopy was performed on day 2 to obtain diagnostic specimens and to look for any airway obstruction by mucous plugging. Bronchoscopy unexpectedly revealed a nearly completely obstructed left main bronchus by a foreign body, which resembled an earring. The foreign body was pulled out using a biopsy forceps. The foreign body became lodged in the endotracheal tube (ETT) necessitating removal of the ETT and foreign body en masse and reintubating the patient with a new ETT. On closer examination of the foreign body was a 25G hypodermic needle []. Subsequent CXR showed clearing of consolidation and the patient was extubated on day 4 and transferred to medical ward for further management. Sputum culture during bronchoscopy also yielded Pseudomonoas aeroginosa, which was sensitive to ticaricillin/caluvulanate. Antibiotics were de-escalated, and the patient was discharged on day 6 with oral antibiotics []. On questioning, it became apparent that she inhaled drugs from the same table she kept her drug paraphernalia. It seemed that while snorting drugs, she inadvertently inhaled the hypodermic needle.",
        "Question": "What is the patient's CURB-65 score?",
        "Relevant Entities": "{'age': [37, 'years'], 'Systolic Blood Pressure': [90.0, 'mm hg'], 'Diastolic Blood Pressure': [50.0, 'mm hg'], 'respiratory rate': [30.0, 'breaths per minute'], 'Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)': [3.5, 'mmol/L']}",
        "Ground Truth Answer": "2",
        "Lower Limit": "2",
        "Upper Limit": "2",
        "Ground Truth Explanation": "The Curb-65 score is current at 0 points.\nThe patient is 37 years old. The patient's age is less than 65 years, and so we add 0 points to the score, keeping the current total at 0.\nWhether the patient has confusion is not reported in the note. Hence, we assume this to be false, and so 0 points are added to the score, making the current total 0.\nThe concentration of BUN is 3.5 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of BUN from mmol to mg. The mass of BUN is 3.5 mmol. To convert 3.5 mmol of BUN to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 3.5 mmol BUN * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.004 mol BUN. To convert from mol BUN to grams, multiply by the molar mass 28.02 g/mol, which will give 0.004 mol BUN * 28.02 g/mol = 0.112 g BUN. To convert 0.112 g of BUN to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.112 g BUN * 1000.0 mg/g = 112.0 mg BUN. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 112.0 mg BUN/10.0 dL = 11.2 mg BUN/dL. The concentration value of 3.5 mmol BUN/L converts to 11.2 mg BUN/dL. The patient's BUN concentration is less than or equal to 19 mg/dL and so 0 points are added to score, keeping the current total at 0.\nThe patient's respiratory rate is 30 breaths per minute. Because the respiratory rate is greater than 30 breaths per minute, 1 point is added to the score, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.\nThe patient's systiolic blood pressure is 90 mm Hg. The patient's diastolic blood pressure is 50 mm Hg. For a point a point to be added, the systiolic blood pressure must be less than 90 mm Hg or the diastolic blood pressure must be less than or equal to 60 mm Hg. Because at least one of these statements is true, 1 point is added to score, making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.\nThe patient's Curb-65 score is 2.",

Her trachea and mainstem bronchi were patent, she had no mediastinal abnormalities, the thoracic aorta was normal in appearance, and she had no pericardial effusion or pneumothorax ().\nA CT of her abdomen and pelvis with contrast in the venous phase was also performed, which showed patent vasculature including a normal caliber aorta and inferior vena cava, normal appearing spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys/ureters, a small hiatal hernia but otherwise normal appearing bowel, and no ascites or pneumoperitoneum. The radiologist did not find any fractures on her imaging or any soft tissue injuries. Initial laboratory studies (), laboratory studies after administration of intravenous fluids (), and the patient\u2019s electrocardiograms (ECG) () are shown. A test was then performed and a diagnosis was made. What are the number of criteria met for the PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolism (PE)?"

This means that the patient takes 10 mg/dose Tapentadol * 2 dose/day = 20 mg/day. To convert to mme/day of Tapentadol, multiply the 20 mg/day by the mme conversion factor, 0.4 mme/mg, giving us 8.0 mme/day. Adding the mme/day of Tapentadol to the total mme/day gives us 0 + 8.0 = 8.0 mme/day.\nThe patient's dose of HYDROcodone is 30 mg. The patient takes 2 doses/day of HYDROcodone. This means that the patient takes 30 mg/dose HYDROcodone * 2 dose/day = 60 mg/day. To convert to mme/day of HYDROcodone, multiply the 60 mg/day by the mme conversion factor, 1 mme/mg, giving us 60 mme/day. Adding the mme/day of HYDROcodone to the total mme/day gives us 8.0 + 60 = 68.0 mme/day.\nThe patient's dose of FentANYL patch is 70 mg. The patient takes 2 doses/day of FentANYL patch. This means that the patient takes 70 mg/dose FentANYL patch * 2 dose/day = 140 mg/day. To convert to mme/day of FentANYL patch, multiply the 140 mg/day by the mme conversion factor, 2.4 mme/mg, giving us 336.0 mme/day.

On physical examination, he was found to be febrile, somnolent, and polypneic, with marked respiratory effort. Emergency orotracheal intubation and transfer to the intensive care unit were necessary.\nInitial screening showed thrombocytopenia (platelet count 138 \u00d7 103 cells/\u00b5l), leukocytosis (WBC 15,760 cells/ml, 90% neutrophils) with lymphopenia (6.20% lymphocytes), elevated transaminases (ALT 1507.4 IU and AST 3049.7 IU), elevated d-dimer (44,066 \u00b5g/ml), and negative RT-PCR SARS CoV-2 test. Chest X-ray showed extensive interstitial infiltrates in both lung fields (Fig. b). Considering the progressive decrease in total platelet count as well as gradual lymphopenia (Fig. ), a dengue IgM/IgG test was conducted and was positive, while the dengue PCR-RT test was negative. According to radiographic findings and respiratory involvement, the RT-PCR test for SARS CoV-2 was repeated on two more occasions, with negative results. Therefore, IgG antibodies for SARS CoV-2 were assayed and were positive.\nPositive serology for both SARS CoV-2 and dengue virus confirmed coinfection, so it was considered that he had probably entered a late stage of the disease. Steroid management was indicated according to COVID-19 management guidelines, in addition to pronation cycles, to which he presented poor response and persistent hypoxemia. During his stay in intensive care, he presented multiple complications, such as acute pulmonary embolism, with signs of secondary thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, bacterial superinfection in his lungs by Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Akin III acute renal failure. Computerized tomography angiography of the chest was performed, which confirmed acute pulmonary thromboembolism of multiple bilateral lobar and segmental bilateral branches with signs of secondary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary changes suggestive of organizing pneumonia secondary to viral infection (Fig. ).

        "Ground Truth Answer": "3",
        "Lower Limit": "3",
        "Upper Limit": "3",
        "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0.\nThe patient's temperature is 38.0 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is between 36 and 38 degrees celsius, this does not meet SIRS criteria for temperature, and so the current total remains at 0.\nThe patient's heart rate is 74.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is less than 90 beats per minute, this does not meet SIRS criteria for heart rate, and so the current total remains at 0.\nThe patient's concentration of white blood cell is 15760.0 count/mL. To convert 15760.0 count/mL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 mL/m^3 which will give 15760.0 white blood cell count/mL * 1000000.0 mL/m^3 = 15760000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.\nThe final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO\u2082 partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 50.0 breaths per minute, which is greater than 20 breaths per minute. The patient's PaCO\u2082 partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.At least one of the criteria is met, and so we increment the criteria count by 1 giving us a total of 2 + 1 = 3 criteria met.\nHence, the the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient is 3.",

Family, surgical and drug histories were unrevealing. On examination, he was obese (weight 89.8 Kg, height 159 cm, body mass index 35.9) and has an arm span of 165 cm. Systemic examination was unremarkable apart from mild hepatomegaly. Local examination revealed bilateral soft breast enlargement 14\u00d710\u00d710 cm (), with non tender sub-areolar mass concentric, areola (3.5 x 3.5 cm), with regular borders, and free from underlying and overlying tissues. He has a little facial hair, scanty axillary and pubic hair, small and atrophic testes, and small non-buried penis. All routine biochemical reports were within normal limits. Hormonal assay revealed hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism on the basis of low serum total testosterone, high luteinizing hormone, and high follicle stimulating hormone with normal prolactin, estradiol, thyroid stimulating hormone, cortisol, beta human chorionic gonadotrophin, and alpha fetoprotein.

        "Patient Note": "A 3.5-year-old girl was transferred to our institution from a local hospital with abdominal pain and bilious vomiting for further investigation and management. The child was diagnosed with isovaleric acidemia in the neonatal period, because there was a positive family history of a sibling death from this inherited disorder. Hence, measurement of elevated concentrations of isovalerylglycine in urine and of isovalerylcarnitine in plasma by mass spectrometry [] was performed after birth; then, isovaleric acid CoA dehydrogenase deficiency was confirmed by assaying its enzymatic activity in cultured skin fibroblasts [].\nThe child was admitted to the local hospital two days ago because of new-onset upper abdominal pain. Although she was unable to describe the nature and character of the pain, it was not severe enough to require analgesics. One day prior to her admission to us, she developed vomiting that eventually became bilious.\nThe patient who had normal growth and development was on oral L-carnitine supplementation since infancy. Beside that, she was not receiving any other medications. Her family history was negative for pancreatitis. On admission to us, she was afebrile with normal vital signs. On physical examination, there was moderate upper abdominal tenderness without rebound, while she had normal bowel sounds and no organomegaly. Laboratory studies on admission revealed the following: leukocytes 10,110/\u03bcL, hemoglobin 14 g/dL, hematocrit 37.2%, platelets 169,000/\u03bcL, glucose 185 mg/dL (normal < 100 mg/dL), urea 26 mg/dL, creatinine 0.4 mg/dL, sodium 133 mEq/L, potassium 3.6 mEq/L, chloride 103 mEq/L, AST 34 U/L, ALT 22 U/L, LDH 426 U/L (normal < 280 U/L), albumin 4.3 g/dL, total bilirubin 0.7 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.2 mg/dL, \u03b3-GT 16 U/L, triglycerides 80 mg/dL, calcium 10 mg/dL, and amylase 536 U/L (normal 40\u2013140 U/L). Arterial blood gases showed the following: pH 7.55, pCO2 21 mmHg, pO2 133 mmHg, HCO3 23 mmol/L, and base deficit 3.8 mmol/L. The anion gap was estimated at 7. A coagulation profile and a urine analysis were normal.\nDue to the bilious nature of vomiting, an abdominal ultrasound () was obtained that showed a notably enlarged and edematous pancreas, along with the presence of peripancreatic exudates that were extending bilaterally towards the anterior paranephric spaces and towards the right colon. The wall of the duodenum was also diffusely edematous. No gallstones were seen, the bile duct was not distended, and there was no sludge in it, while the liver, spleen, and appendix were visualized without echomorphologic abnormalities.\nSince the goal of management of acute pancreatitis is to achieve analgesia, adequate rehydration, and organ rest, the child was managed with discontinuation of oral feedings, placement of a nasogastric tube, intravenous hydration with 5% dextrose with electrolytes, and administration of intravenous ranitidine and of L-carnitine, 500 mg every 8 hours, that is, approximately 100 mg/kg/day.\nThe patient's clinical course was uncomplicated. Serum amylase normalized (84 U/L) on the 4th hospital day. She was fed with a low-fat and protein diet on the 6th hospital day. On the same day, the intravenous fluids were discontinued. Two follow-up ultrasonographic examinations on the 3rd and 5th () hospital days showed progressive but rapid resolution of the pancreatic edema and of the peripancreatic exudates.

The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 133.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 103.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 23.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 23.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 23.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 23.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 23.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 23.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 133.0 mEq/L - (103.0 mEq/L + 23.0 mEq/L) = 7.0 mEq/L.

        "Patient Note": "A 43 year-old male was referred to the Emergency Department (ED) of our hospital after his workplace colleagues noted increasingly strange behavior for three days. The patient arrived complaining of generalized fatigue, lethargy, fevers, severe band-like headache, slurred speech, and increasing confusion. Though it was felt that the patient\u2019s history was not completely reliable secondary to confusion, he was able to deny throat pain, chest pain, diarrhea, abdominal pain, recent sick contacts, or recent travel. Review of systems was limited secondary to altered mental status, but he did admit to mild dry cough.\nThough initially denying immune compromise in the ED, the patient later disclosed he was HIV+. He could not recall his CD4 count but stated that his last viral load was undetectable. Past medical history was significant for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Outpatient medications included Atripla, spironolactone, and gemfibrozil. He had a history of unprotected anal sex with men but denied new partners. He had no recent contact with animals. He smoked a pack of cigarettes per day but did not drink or use drugs.\nIn the ED, the patient\u2019s temperature was 103.9\u00b0F (39.9\u00b0C). Heart rate was 121 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. Blood pressure was 142/90. The patient appeared unwell. He was somnolent but easily aroused. Pertinent findings on general physical exam included a supple neck and decreased breath sounds diffusely. On neurologic exam, he was noted to be dysarthric. He had general slowness of thought and processing. He was slightly confused, though he was oriented and able to name the days of the week forwards and backwards if given sufficient time.\nInitial laboratory evaluation was notable for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.1 \u00d7 103 cells/mm3, [lab reference range 4.0\u201310.8], hemoglobin of 15.7 g/dL [lab range 14.0\u201318.0], platelet count of 135 \u00d7 103/mm3 [lab range 150\u2013350]. Automated differential showed 87.5% segmented cells (lab range 30-85%), 9.3% lymphocytes (lab range 15-55%), 2.4% monocytes (lab range 0-10%), 0.8% eosinophils (lab range 0-5%), and 0% basophils. No manual differential was performed. A basic metabolic panel showed serum sodium of 134 mmol/L [lab range 137\u2013145], serum potassium of 4.2 mmol/L (lab range 3.5-5.1), serum chloride of 100 mmol/L (lab range 98\u2013107), and CO2 of 19 mmol/L [lab range 22.0\u201330.0]. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and serum glucose were elevated at 33 mg/dL [lab range 9\u201320], 1.8 mg/dL [lab range 0.7\u20131.3] and 159 mg/dL [lab range 70\u201399], respectively. C-reactive protein (CRP) was high at 581 mg/dL [lab range 0\u201310]. Liver function studies showed an albumin level of 4.4 g/dL (lab range 3.5-5.0), total protein of 7.6 g/dL (lab range 6.3-8.2), total bilirubin of 0.7 mg/dL (lab range 0.2-1.3), direct bilirubin of 0.5 mg/dL (lab range 0\u20130.3), alkaline phosphatase of 62 U/L (lab range 38\u2013126), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 49 U/L (lab range 13\u201369), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 89 U/L (lab range 15\u201346). Urinalysis showed 2+ albumin, 3+ blood, trace WBC esterase, negative nitrite, 5\u201310 WBC, 0\u20135 red blood cells (RBC), 5\u201310 epithelial cells, 5\u201310 hyaline casts, 3+ amorphous cells, and 1+ mucous. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head did not reveal any abnormalities. Nasopharyngeal influenza assay was negative.\nDue to the combination of altered mental status, headache, and fever, a lumbar puncture was performed. The results demonstrated an elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose of 97 mg/dL [normal 40\u201370], CSF protein of 37 mg/dL [normal 12\u201360], and normal cell count and gram stain. Blood cultures were sent.\nA chest x-ray was done and was read as a left hilar mass extending down towards the left lower lobe (see Figure \n). A chest CT was obtained to better characterize the hilar mass (see Figure \n). This chest CT demonstrated a left lower lobe consolidation with air bronchograms suggesting a diagnosis of pneumonia. Based upon the aforementioned findings, the patient was started on azithromycin and ceftriaxone for community-acquired pneumonia, as well as empiric acyclovir for herpes encephalitis.\nGiven the findings of dysarthria and altered mental status in an HIV + individual with unknown CD4+ count, a brain MRI was obtained. No contrast was administered secondary to acute renal injury. The diffusion-weighted coronal cut can be seen in Figure \n, demonstrating abnormal restricted diffusion and swelling of the splenium of the corpus callosum without other significant abnormalities. Abnormal T2-weighted signal in the SCC can be seen in Figure \n. These MRI findings in an HIV + individual raised concern for CNS opportunistic infection. However, since the patient was hemodynamically stable, was on antiretroviral therapy, and had a negative lumbar puncture, it was decided to treat the pneumonia initially and closely monitor the patient\u2019s mental status.\nOver the first two to three days of hospitalization, the patient continued to have high fevers, confusion, and dysarthria. His laboratory markers improved on antibiotics. His serum CRP trended down from 581 mg/L at admission to 200 mg/L on day three. After day three the patient began to demonstrate significant clinical improvement. The patient\u2019s admission CD4+ count returned on day three at 156 cells/mm3, and an HIV viral load came back on day four at <20 copies/mL. On day four, urine antigens for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 were sent. By day five the patient\u2019s neurologic symptoms had resolved, as had his acute renal insufficiency. This same day his Legionella pneumophila urinary antigen returned positive.\nOn hospital day six a repeat MRI was obtained to monitor radiologic progression of the SCC lesion. This repeat study showed partial interval clearing of the previously noted abnormalities: restricted diffusion, abnormal increased flair, and abnormal T2 signally in the SCC. On hospital day seven the patient was discharged home on oral azithromycin. He had no residual deficits. Initial CSF viral studies including herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella, cytomegalovirus, enterovirus, and JC virus all returned negative, as did the syphilis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C serologies. Sputum for acid fast bacilli and routine culture were negative. Legionella antibody IgG titers sent on day four later came back at 1:64.",

Hence, the concentration value of 19.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 19.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (100.0 mEq/L + 19.0 mEq/L) = 15.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 15.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 4.4 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 15.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 4.4 (in g/dL)) = 14.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 14.0 mEq/L.",

        "Usr Msg": "A 43 year-old male was referred to the Emergency Department (ED) of our hospital after his workplace colleagues noted increasingly strange behavior for three days. The patient arrived complaining of generalized fatigue, lethargy, fevers, severe band-like headache, slurred speech, and increasing confusion. Though it was felt that the patient\u2019s history was not completely reliable secondary to confusion, he was able to deny throat pain, chest pain, diarrhea, abdominal pain, recent sick contacts, or recent travel. Review of systems was limited secondary to altered mental status, but he did admit to mild dry cough.\nThough initially denying immune compromise in the ED, the patient later disclosed he was HIV+. He could not recall his CD4 count but stated that his last viral load was undetectable. Past medical history was significant for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Outpatient medications included Atripla, spironolactone, and gemfibrozil. He had a history of unprotected anal sex with men but denied new partners. He had no recent contact with animals. He smoked a pack of cigarettes per day but did not drink or use drugs.\nIn the ED, the patient\u2019s temperature was 103.9\u00b0F (39.9\u00b0C). Heart rate was 121 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. Blood pressure was 142/90. The patient appeared unwell. He was somnolent but easily aroused. Pertinent findings on general physical exam included a supple neck and decreased breath sounds diffusely. On neurologic exam, he was noted to be dysarthric. He had general slowness of thought and processing. He was slightly confused, though he was oriented and able to name the days of the week forwards and backwards if given sufficient time.\nInitial laboratory evaluation was notable for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.1 \u00d7 103 cells/mm3, [lab reference range 4.0\u201310.8], hemoglobin of 15.7 g/dL [lab range 14.0\u201318.0], platelet count of 135 \u00d7 103/mm3 [lab range 150\u2013350]. Automated differential showed 87.5% segmented cells (lab range 30-85%), 9.3% lymphocytes (lab range 15-55%), 2.4% monocytes (lab range 0-10%), 0.8% eosinophils (lab range 0-5%), and 0% basophils. No manual differential was performed. A basic metabolic panel showed serum sodium of 134 mmol/L [lab range 137\u2013145], serum potassium of 4.2 mmol/L (lab range 3.5-5.1), serum chloride of 100 mmol/L (lab range 98\u2013107), and CO2 of 19 mmol/L [lab range 22.0\u201330.0]. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and serum glucose were elevated at 33 mg/dL [lab range 9\u201320], 1.8 mg/dL [lab range 0.7\u20131.3] and 159 mg/dL [lab range 70\u201399], respectively. C-reactive protein (CRP) was high at 581 mg/dL [lab range 0\u201310]. Liver function studies showed an albumin level of 4.4 g/dL (lab range 3.5-5.0), total protein of 7.6 g/dL (lab range 6.3-8.2), total bilirubin of 0.7 mg/dL (lab range 0.2-1.3), direct bilirubin of 0.5 mg/dL (lab range 0\u20130.3), alkaline phosphatase of 62 U/L (lab range 38\u2013126), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 49 U/L (lab range 13\u201369), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 89 U/L (lab range 15\u201346). Urinalysis showed 2+ albumin, 3+ blood, trace WBC esterase, negative nitrite, 5\u201310 WBC, 0\u20135 red blood cells (RBC), 5\u201310 epithelial cells, 5\u201310 hyaline casts, 3+ amorphous cells, and 1+ mucous. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head did not reveal any abnormalities. Nasopharyngeal influenza assay was negative.\nDue to the combination of altered mental status, headache, and fever, a lumbar puncture was performed. The results demonstrated an elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose of 97 mg/dL [normal 40\u201370], CSF protein of 37 mg/dL [normal 12\u201360], and normal cell count and gram stain. Blood cultures were sent.\nA chest x-ray was done and was read as a left hilar mass extending down towards the left lower lobe (see Figure \n). A chest CT was obtained to better characterize the hilar mass (see Figure \n). This chest CT demonstrated a left lower lobe consolidation with air bronchograms suggesting a diagnosis of pneumonia. Based upon the aforementioned findings, the patient was started on azithromycin and ceftriaxone for community-acquired pneumonia, as well as empiric acyclovir for herpes encephalitis.\nGiven the findings of dysarthria and altered mental status in an HIV + individual with unknown CD4+ count, a brain MRI was obtained. No contrast was administered secondary to acute renal injury. The diffusion-weighted coronal cut can be seen in Figure \n, demonstrating abnormal restricted diffusion and swelling of the splenium of the corpus callosum without other significant abnormalities. Abnormal T2-weighted signal in the SCC can be seen in Figure \n. These MRI findings in an HIV + individual raised concern for CNS opportunistic infection. However, since the patient was hemodynamically stable, was on antiretroviral therapy, and had a negative lumbar puncture, it was decided to treat the pneumonia initially and closely monitor the patient\u2019s mental status.\nOver the first two to three days of hospitalization, the patient continued to have high fevers, confusion, and dysarthria. His laboratory markers improved on antibiotics. His serum CRP trended down from 581 mg/L at admission to 200 mg/L on day three. After day three the patient began to demonstrate significant clinical improvement. The patient\u2019s admission CD4+ count returned on day three at 156 cells/mm3, and an HIV viral load came back on day four at <20 copies/mL. On day four, urine antigens for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 were sent. By day five the patient\u2019s neurologic symptoms had resolved, as had his acute renal insufficiency. This same day his Legionella pneumophila urinary antigen returned positive.\nOn hospital day six a repeat MRI was obtained to monitor radiologic progression of the SCC lesion. This repeat study showed partial interval clearing of the previously noted abnormalities: restricted diffusion, abnormal increased flair, and abnormal T2 signally in the SCC. On hospital day seven the patient was discharged home on oral azithromycin. He had no residual deficits. Initial CSF viral studies including herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella, cytomegalovirus, enterovirus, and JC virus all returned negative, as did the syphilis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C serologies. Sputum for acid fast bacilli and routine culture were negative. Legionella antibody IgG titers sent on day four later came back at 1:64. What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?"

        "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.\nThe formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 141.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 104.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 29.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 141.0 mEq/L - (104.0 mEq/L + 29.0 mEq/L) = 8.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 8.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 43.0 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 43.0 g albumin/10.0 dL = 4.3 g albumin/dL. The concentration value of 43.0 g albumin/L converts to 4.3 g albumin/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 8.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 4.3 (in g/dL)) = 7.25 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 7.25 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 7.25 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 7.25 - 12 = -4.75 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is -4.75 mEq/L.",

        "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the albumin corrected delta ratio is albumin corrected delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L).\nTo compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.\nThe formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 134.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 134.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 134.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 134.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 134.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 134.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 100.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 100.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 100.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 100.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 100.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 100.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 19.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 19.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 19.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 19.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 19.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 19.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (100.0 mEq/L + 19.0 mEq/L) = 15.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 15.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 4.4 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 15.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 4.4 (in g/dL)) = 14.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 14.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 14.0 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 14.0 - 12 = 2.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 2.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in the albumin corrected delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration into the albumin corrected delta ratio formula, we get 2.0 mEq/L / 5.0 mEq/L = 0.4. The patient's albumin corrected delta ratio is 0.4.",

        "Usr Msg": "A 43 year-old male was referred to the Emergency Department (ED) of our hospital after his workplace colleagues noted increasingly strange behavior for three days. The patient arrived complaining of generalized fatigue, lethargy, fevers, severe band-like headache, slurred speech, and increasing confusion. Though it was felt that the patient\u2019s history was not completely reliable secondary to confusion, he was able to deny throat pain, chest pain, diarrhea, abdominal pain, recent sick contacts, or recent travel. Review of systems was limited secondary to altered mental status, but he did admit to mild dry cough.\nThough initially denying immune compromise in the ED, the patient later disclosed he was HIV+. He could not recall his CD4 count but stated that his last viral load was undetectable. Past medical history was significant for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Outpatient medications included Atripla, spironolactone, and gemfibrozil. He had a history of unprotected anal sex with men but denied new partners. He had no recent contact with animals. He smoked a pack of cigarettes per day but did not drink or use drugs.\nIn the ED, the patient\u2019s temperature was 103.9\u00b0F (39.9\u00b0C). Heart rate was 121 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. Blood pressure was 142/90. The patient appeared unwell. He was somnolent but easily aroused. Pertinent findings on general physical exam included a supple neck and decreased breath sounds diffusely. On neurologic exam, he was noted to be dysarthric. He had general slowness of thought and processing. He was slightly confused, though he was oriented and able to name the days of the week forwards and backwards if given sufficient time.\nInitial laboratory evaluation was notable for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.1 \u00d7 103 cells/mm3, [lab reference range 4.0\u201310.8], hemoglobin of 15.7 g/dL [lab range 14.0\u201318.0], platelet count of 135 \u00d7 103/mm3 [lab range 150\u2013350]. Automated differential showed 87.5% segmented cells (lab range 30-85%), 9.3% lymphocytes (lab range 15-55%), 2.4% monocytes (lab range 0-10%), 0.8% eosinophils (lab range 0-5%), and 0% basophils. No manual differential was performed. A basic metabolic panel showed serum sodium of 134 mmol/L [lab range 137\u2013145], serum potassium of 4.2 mmol/L (lab range 3.5-5.1), serum chloride of 100 mmol/L (lab range 98\u2013107), and CO2 of 19 mmol/L [lab range 22.0\u201330.0]. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and serum glucose were elevated at 33 mg/dL [lab range 9\u201320], 1.8 mg/dL [lab range 0.7\u20131.3] and 159 mg/dL [lab range 70\u201399], respectively. C-reactive protein (CRP) was high at 581 mg/dL [lab range 0\u201310]. Liver function studies showed an albumin level of 4.4 g/dL (lab range 3.5-5.0), total protein of 7.6 g/dL (lab range 6.3-8.2), total bilirubin of 0.7 mg/dL (lab range 0.2-1.3), direct bilirubin of 0.5 mg/dL (lab range 0\u20130.3), alkaline phosphatase of 62 U/L (lab range 38\u2013126), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 49 U/L (lab range 13\u201369), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 89 U/L (lab range 15\u201346). Urinalysis showed 2+ albumin, 3+ blood, trace WBC esterase, negative nitrite, 5\u201310 WBC, 0\u20135 red blood cells (RBC), 5\u201310 epithelial cells, 5\u201310 hyaline casts, 3+ amorphous cells, and 1+ mucous. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head did not reveal any abnormalities. Nasopharyngeal influenza assay was negative.\nDue to the combination of altered mental status, headache, and fever, a lumbar puncture was performed. The results demonstrated an elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose of 97 mg/dL [normal 40\u201370], CSF protein of 37 mg/dL [normal 12\u201360], and normal cell count and gram stain. Blood cultures were sent.\nA chest x-ray was done and was read as a left hilar mass extending down towards the left lower lobe (see Figure \n). A chest CT was obtained to better characterize the hilar mass (see Figure \n). This chest CT demonstrated a left lower lobe consolidation with air bronchograms suggesting a diagnosis of pneumonia. Based upon the aforementioned findings, the patient was started on azithromycin and ceftriaxone for community-acquired pneumonia, as well as empiric acyclovir for herpes encephalitis.\nGiven the findings of dysarthria and altered mental status in an HIV + individual with unknown CD4+ count, a brain MRI was obtained. No contrast was administered secondary to acute renal injury. The diffusion-weighted coronal cut can be seen in Figure \n, demonstrating abnormal restricted diffusion and swelling of the splenium of the corpus callosum without other significant abnormalities. Abnormal T2-weighted signal in the SCC can be seen in Figure \n. These MRI findings in an HIV + individual raised concern for CNS opportunistic infection. However, since the patient was hemodynamically stable, was on antiretroviral therapy, and had a negative lumbar puncture, it was decided to treat the pneumonia initially and closely monitor the patient\u2019s mental status.\nOver the first two to three days of hospitalization, the patient continued to have high fevers, confusion, and dysarthria. His laboratory markers improved on antibiotics. His serum CRP trended down from 581 mg/L at admission to 200 mg/L on day three. After day three the patient began to demonstrate significant clinical improvement. The patient\u2019s admission CD4+ count returned on day three at 156 cells/mm3, and an HIV viral load came back on day four at <20 copies/mL. On day four, urine antigens for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 were sent. By day five the patient\u2019s neurologic symptoms had resolved, as had his acute renal insufficiency. This same day his Legionella pneumophila urinary antigen returned positive.\nOn hospital day six a repeat MRI was obtained to monitor radiologic progression of the SCC lesion. This repeat study showed partial interval clearing of the previously noted abnormalities: restricted diffusion, abnormal increased flair, and abnormal T2 signally in the SCC. On hospital day seven the patient was discharged home on oral azithromycin. He had no residual deficits. Initial CSF viral studies including herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella, cytomegalovirus, enterovirus, and JC virus all returned negative, as did the syphilis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C serologies. Sputum for acid fast bacilli and routine culture were negative. Legionella antibody IgG titers sent on day four later came back at 1:64. What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?"
